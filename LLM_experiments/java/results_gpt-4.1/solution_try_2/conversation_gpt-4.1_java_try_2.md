## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  

**LLM Response:**

Summary of Project Description:  
You are tasked with developing a Java project that processes amino acid sequences from different species. The main objectives are:

1. **Sequence Similarity Calculation:**  
   - Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute pairwise similarity scores between amino acid sequences.
   - Use a predefined dictionary of substitution (swapping) scores for the alignment.

2. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:**  
   - Based on the computed similarity (or distance) matrix, construct a phylogenetic tree representing the evolutionary relationships among the species.
   - Visualize this tree as a dendrogram.

3. **Clustering:**  
   - Enable clustering of species based on the phylogenetic tree.
   - Allow dynamic clustering depending on user-defined similarity/distance thresholds.

Project Outline – Key Aspects:

1. **Input Handling:**  
   - Efficiently parse and store amino acid sequences for multiple species.
   - Load and manage the substitution score dictionary.

2. **Algorithm Implementation:**  
   - Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.
   - Calculate pairwise similarity/distance matrix for all species.

3. **Tree Construction & Visualization:**  
   - Build a phylogenetic tree (e.g., using UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining algorithms).
   - Generate a dendrogram visualization of the tree.

4. **Clustering Functionality:**  
   - Provide methods to extract clusters from the tree based on adjustable thresholds.

5. **Clean, Modular Code:**  
   - Ensure code is well-structured, efficient, and maintainable.
   - Use appropriate data structures and design patterns.

If you have any preferences for libraries, frameworks, or specific output formats, please specify. Otherwise, I am ready to proceed with detailed planning or code generation for any of the outlined components.
## Prompt 3

**User:** Goal: Setting up technical requirements for all code solutions generated through the conversation. 
Instruction: I need this program to be written in Java 21, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using Maven 3.9 to build a project. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow Google Java Style Guide formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified requirement. Apply it to every code generated in further parts of conversation, but do not generate any code for this answer.

**LLM Response:**

Confirmed. All code solutions will be written in Java 21, using Maven 3.9 for project management. I will freely select necessary libraries as needed. Any file operations will use paths relative to the current directory, with subfolders as appropriate. All code will adhere to the Google Java Style Guide and be clean, efficient, and production-ready. Each code sample will include the target filename. I will apply these requirements to every code generation in this conversation. No code will be generated in this response. Please proceed with your next instruction or request.
## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

Summary of Needleman-Wunsch Task Requirements:

1. **Purpose:**  
   - Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align amino acid sequences for different species, using a substitution matrix (BLOSUM50 or BLOSUM62) for scoring.

2. **Input Files:**  
   - **organisms.json:**  
     - JSON object where each key is a species name (String) and each value is its amino acid sequence (String).
   - **blosumXX.json:**  
     - JSON object representing a substitution matrix.
     - Keys:  
       - Single character (e.g., "a"): cost of deleting that character.
       - Two-character string (e.g., "ab" or "ba"): cost of substituting one character for another.
     - Values:  
       - Integer or double representing the score for the operation.

3. **Functionality:**  
   - For any pair of species, calculate the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score using the loaded BLOSUM matrix.
   - Support both BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 matrices, with the ability to switch between them for different runs (but only one per run).

4. **Constraints:**  
   - Input and output file paths must be relative to the current directory.
   - Code must be clean, efficient, production-ready, and follow the Google Java Style Guide.
   - The solution should be modular to allow easy integration with further project components (e.g., batch processing of all pairs, integration with clustering/tree-building logic).

5. **Assumptions:**  
   - Only one BLOSUM matrix is used per execution.
   - The JSON structure for both files is as described.
   - The code will be used as a foundational component for further analysis (e.g., pairwise similarity matrix calculation).

If this summary matches your expectations, please specify the next step or request code generation for a particular part of this task.
## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following Java code provides a production-ready solution for the first task:  
- Reads amino acid sequences from organisms.json.  
- Reads a BLOSUM matrix from blosumXX.json.  
- For each unique pair of species, calculates the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score using integer scores/penalties from the BLOSUM matrix.  
- Stores the results in a fast-access structure (Map of pairs to scores).  
- Code is modular, clean, and ready for further extension.

**How it works:**  
- Reads both input files.
- For each unique pair of species, computes the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score using integer BLOSUM scores.
- Stores results in a fast-access structure for later use.
- Prints scores for each pair (can be removed or redirected as needed).

**Test:**  
With the provided test case, the output for the pair ("testspecies1", "testspecies2") will be 7, as required.

Let me know if you want to add unit tests or further extend this module!
## Prompt 6

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following modification adds functionality to save the calculated Needleman-Wunsch scores to a JSON file. The output file is named according to the BLOSUM matrix used (e.g., `organisms_scores_blosum50.json` or `organisms_scores_blosum62.json`). The JSON structure is a key-value map where the key is the concatenation of the two species names with an underscore (`_`), and the value is the alignment score (integer).

**Key changes:**
- Added a utility method to write the similarity matrix to a JSON file.
- Modified `Main.java` to determine the output filename based on the input BLOSUM file and to call the new save method after calculation.

**What the code does:**  
- Calculates Needleman-Wunsch scores for all unique species pairs.
- Stores results in a fast-access structure.
- Saves the results as a JSON file named according to the BLOSUM matrix used, with keys in the format `species1_species2` and integer values.

**No changes are needed to other files.**  
This modification is clean, modular, and ready for further extension.
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

**Summary of Second Task Requirements:**

1. **Objective:**  
   - Build a phylogenetic tree (hierarchical, agglomerative clustering) using the previously computed Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as the measure of similarity between species.

2. **Clustering Methodology:**  
   - Use an agglomerative (bottom-up) approach, merging the two clusters/nodes with the highest similarity score at each step (single linkage).
   - Unlike standard clustering libraries that operate on distances (where lower is more similar), this solution must operate on raw similarity scores (where higher is more similar).
   - The tree must be constructed directly from similarity scores, not from converted distances.

3. **Tree Structure and Output:**  
   - The resulting tree should represent evolutionary relationships, with leaves as species and internal nodes as inferred ancestors.
   - The tree structure must support:
     - Efficient extraction of clusters based on a similarity threshold (thresholds will be chosen from the actual range of Needleman-Wunsch scores).
     - Exporting the tree in Newick format (for interoperability and visualization).
     - Drawing a dendrogram (for visualization).

4. **Preparation for Future Tasks:**  
   - The tree data structure should be designed to allow:
     - Traversal and manipulation for clustering at different similarity thresholds.
     - Easy conversion to Newick format.
     - Support for dendrogram drawing (e.g., by storing branch lengths or similarity values at each node).

5. **Constraints and Considerations:**  
   - All operations must use the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores (not converted to distances).
   - The code must be modular, efficient, and production-ready, following the Google Java Style Guide.
   - The solution should be ready for integration with further tasks (clustering, visualization, export).

**If this summary matches your expectations, please specify the next step or request code generation for a particular part of this task.**
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code introduces a modular, production-ready tree structure for representing the evolutionary history of species using single-linkage agglomerative clustering, operating directly on Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.  
- Each leaf node represents a species.  
- Each internal node represents a merge event, with its height set to the similarity score at which the merge occurred.  
- The tree is built by repeatedly merging the two clusters with the highest similarity score, until only one root remains.  
- The structure is designed for easy traversal, dendrogram drawing, and Newick export in future tasks.

**What this code does:**  
- Builds a phylogenetic tree using single-linkage clustering, merging clusters with the highest Needleman-Wunsch similarity at each step.
- Each internal node records the similarity score at which its children were merged (as "height").
- The tree structure is ready for future tasks: dendrogram drawing, Newick export, and threshold-based clustering.

**No changes are needed to other files.**  
This solution is modular, efficient, and ready for further extension.
## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code adds the ability to export the constructed phylogenetic tree to two Newick format files:
1. **Standard Newick** (only leaf names, e.g., `(A,B,(C,D));`)
2. **Newick with branch lengths** (leaf names and integer distances, e.g., `(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);`)

The code determines the correct output filenames based on the BLOSUM version used.  
The branch length for each node is calculated as the difference between the parent node's height and the child node's height (for leaves, their height is considered 0).

Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code adds the ability to draw a horizontal dendrogram of the phylogenetic tree and save it as a PNG file named according to the BLOSUM version used (e.g., `phylogenetic_tree_blosum50.png`).  
- The dendrogram is drawn horizontally, with the x-axis representing the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores (heights).
- The code uses the [JFreeSVG](https://github.com/jfree/jfreesvg) and [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart) libraries for drawing, which are robust and Maven-compatible.
- The drawing logic is modular and can be extended or restyled as needed.

- The x-axis is proportional to the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.
- The dendrogram is saved as a PNG file named according to the BLOSUM version used.
- The code is modular and can be restyled or extended for further visualization needs.

**No changes are needed to other files.**  
This solution is ready for integration with the rest of your pipeline.
## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

**Summary of Third Task Requirements:**

1. **Objective:**  
   - For each threshold value provided in `thresholds.txt`, identify clusters of species (leaf nodes) in the phylogenetic tree that remain connected below or at that threshold.

2. **Input:**  
   - `thresholds.txt`: Each line contains a single integer value, representing a similarity threshold (from the range of previously calculated Needleman-Wunsch scores).

3. **Clustering Logic:**  
   - For a given threshold T:
     - Traverse the phylogenetic tree.
     - At each internal node, if its height (similarity score) is greater than T, treat its children as separate clusters.
     - If its height is less than or equal to T, treat all leaves under this node as a single cluster.
   - The process is repeated for each threshold value in the file.

4. **Output:**  
   - For each threshold, output the clusters (groups of species) that remain connected at or below that threshold.
   - The output format and storage method will be specified in the next step.

5. **Constraints and Considerations:**  
   - Thresholds are always integer values and within the range of calculated Needleman-Wunsch scores.
   - The clustering must operate directly on the tree built from similarity scores (not distances).
   - The code must be modular, efficient, and ready for integration with the rest of the pipeline.

6. **Preparation for Future Steps:**  
   - The cluster extraction logic should be reusable and easily adaptable for different output formats or further analysis.

**If this summary matches your expectations, please specify the next step or request code generation for this task.**
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code modification adds the ability to:
- Read integer thresholds from `thresholds.txt`.
- For each threshold, traverse the phylogenetic tree and extract clusters of species (leaf nodes) that remain connected at or below that threshold.
- Store clusters as a `List<List<String>>` for each threshold.
- Print the clusters for each threshold to standard output.
- Save all clusters to a JSON file named `clusters_for_blosumXX.json`, where XX is the BLOSUM version used.
