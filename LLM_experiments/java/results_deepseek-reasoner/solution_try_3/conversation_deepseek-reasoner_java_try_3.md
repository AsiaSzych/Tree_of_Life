## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  

**LLM Response:**

### Project Summary and Outline

**Project Goal:**  
Build a phylogenetic clustering system that processes amino acid sequences to generate species clusters via pairwise similarity scoring, phylogenetic tree construction, and threshold-based clustering.

---

### Key Components and Requirements:  
1. **Input Data:**  
   - Amino acid sequences for multiple species (e.g., `SpeciesA: "MTA...", SpeciesB: "MKY..."`).

2. **Similarity Calculation:**  
   - **Algorithm:** Needleman-Wunsch (global sequence alignment).  
   - **Scoring:** Custom substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM, PAM) and gap penalties.  
   - **Output:** Symmetric similarity matrix for all species pairs.  

3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:**  
   - **Method:** Hierarchical clustering (e.g., UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining) applied to the similarity matrix.  
   - **Output:** Rooted phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) where leaves represent species and branch lengths reflect evolutionary distance.  

4. **Dendrogram Visualization:**  
   - Generate a visual dendrogram from the tree structure (e.g., using Java graphics libraries or export for external tools).  

5. **Threshold-Based Clustering:**  
   - Cut the dendrogram at user-defined distance thresholds to generate species clusters.  
   - Output cluster assignments (e.g., `Threshold=0.8 ‚Üí Cluster1: [SpeciesA, SpeciesB], Cluster2: [SpeciesC]`).  

---

### Technical Outline:  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Parse input sequences into structured data (e.g., `Map<String, String>`: species ‚Üí sequence).  

2. **Pairwise Alignment:**  
   - Implement Needleman-Wunsch with configurable scoring (substitution matrix + gap penalties).  
   - Optimize for performance (e.g., dynamic programming, space/time trade-offs).  

3. **Similarity ‚Üí Distance Conversion:**  
   - Convert alignment scores to evolutionary distances (e.g., normalize scores, handle symmetry).  

4. **Hierarchical Clustering:**  
   - Implement UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining to build the tree from the distance matrix.  
   - Tree node structure: `{name, distance, leftChild, rightChild}`.  

5. **Dendrogram & Clustering:**  
   - **Visualization:** Use Java Swing/JavaFX or export Newick format for external tools (e.g., FigTree).  
   - **Clustering:** Traverse tree to extract clusters at given thresholds (e.g., DFS/BFS with distance checks).  

6. **API Design:**  
   - Configurable parameters: scoring matrix, gap penalties, clustering method, thresholds.  
   - Outputs: Similarity matrix, Newick tree, cluster lists, dendrogram image.  

---

### Next Steps:  
1. Confirm scoring matrix/gap penalty values (default or user-provided).  
2. Specify dendrogram output format (image/Newick/text-based).  
3. Discuss performance needs (e.g., sequence length, number of species).  

**Ready to proceed.** Share the first task (e.g., scoring logic, alignment implementation).

## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called ‚ÄúblosumXX.json‚Äù, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{‚Äúa‚Äù: -1, ‚Äúb‚Äù: -2, ‚Äúab‚Äù: -3, ‚Äúba": -3, ‚Äúaa‚Äù: 2, ‚Äúbb‚Äù: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are given two input files:\n  1. organisms.json: Contains a JSON object mapping species names (strings) to their amino acid sequences (strings).\n  2. blosumXX.json (where XX is 50 or 62): Contains a JSON object that represents the BLOSUM substitution matrix and gap penalties.\n\n The BLOSUM file has keys that are either:\n   - Single character (e.g., "a"): represents the gap penalty (cost for deleting or inserting that amino acid).\n   - Two characters (e.g., "ab"): represents the substitution score for aligning amino acid \'a\' with \'b\'. Note that the order does not matter? But the example includes both "ab" and "ba" with the same score. However, in reality, the matrix is symmetric. We must note that the file might have both orders? Or we can assume that for any pair (x, y), the key will be either "xy" or "yx"? Actually, the example shows both. So we must be cautious.\n\n However, the example says:\n   - key "a": gap penalty for amino acid \'a\'\n   - key "ab": substitution cost for aligning \'a\' with \'b\' (and also "ba" is provided, but same value).\n\n But note: In the example, the gap penalty is given per amino acid? Actually, in standard Needleman-Wunsch, we have a fixed gap penalty or sometimes a linear gap penalty that is independent of the amino acid. However, the problem states that the key is a single character and represents the cost of deleting that character. So we have an amino-acid-specific gap penalty.\n\n Steps for the task:\n 1. Read the organisms.json file and parse it into a Map<String, String> (species name -> sequence).\n 2. Read the blosumXX.json file and parse it into a structure that can provide:\n      a) The gap penalty for a particular amino acid (when we have a gap in one sequence and that amino acid in the other).\n      b) The substitution score for a pair of amino acids (for two aligned amino acids).\n\n 3. Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm that:\n      - Takes two sequences (strings of amino acids) and the scoring matrix (with gap penalties and substitution scores).\n      - Computes the global alignment score.\n\n 4. We must note that the scoring matrix is provided for single amino acids (gap) and pairs (substitution). Also, the two-character keys: the order might be arbitrary? We should design the scoring function to look for both orders? Or note that the matrix is symmetric and we can enforce a canonical order (e.g., lexicographically sorted: so for two amino acids x and y, we form the key by putting the smaller one first? But the example includes both "ab" and "ba". Alternatively, we can assume that the file has both? And we can use either? Actually, the example says: "ab" and "ba" both have the same value. So we can pick one and if not found, try the reverse? Or we can preprocess the matrix to store the scores in a way that we always look up in a canonical form.\n\n 5. We are to compute the score for every pair of species. The output will be a symmetric matrix (or a structure that holds the score for each pair) that we can then use for building the phylogenetic tree.\n\n Important considerations for the algorithm:\n  - We are only required to compute the score (not the actual alignment) for efficiency? But the problem says: "calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score". So we don\'t need to backtrack to get the alignment, just the score.\n\n  - The algorithm uses dynamic programming. We have two sequences: sequence1 of length m and sequence2 of length n.\n\n  - We need a scoring function that, given two amino acids (or one amino acid and a gap), returns the score.\n\n  - For a gap, we use the gap penalty from the matrix for the specific amino acid that is present (so when we have a gap in sequence1 and an amino acid \'a\' in sequence2, we use the gap penalty for \'a\'? Actually, the problem says: "deleting that character". So if we consider the deletion in the first sequence (meaning we are inserting a gap in the first sequence and aligning it with the amino acid in the second sequence), then the cost is the gap penalty for the amino acid in the second sequence? Or if we are aligning an amino acid in the first sequence with a gap, then we use the gap penalty for that amino acid in the first sequence? The problem states: "deleting that character" - meaning if we delete an amino acid from a sequence, we use the gap penalty for that amino acid. So:\n\n        When aligning amino acid x from sequence1 with a gap (because we are deleting x from sequence1), we use gap penalty for x (from the matrix, key = String.valueOf(x)).\n        Similarly, when aligning a gap with amino acid y from sequence2 (deleting y from sequence2), we use gap penalty for y.\n\n  - However, note that in the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, we usually have a fixed gap penalty for opening a gap and sometimes an extension penalty. But here the gap penalty is per amino acid. And it is linear (since we are only given one value per amino acid, and we use that for every gap). So it is an affine gap penalty? Actually, no. It is a linear gap penalty but the cost for a gap of length k would be the sum of the gap penalties for each amino acid skipped? Actually, no: in the standard linear gap penalty, we have a constant cost per gap. But here, the cost per gap is variable per amino acid.\n\n  - Actually, the problem says: "deleting that character" meaning each deletion of a single amino acid has a cost specific to that amino acid. Therefore, when we have a consecutive gap of k amino acids, the total cost would be the sum of the gap penalties for each of the k amino acids.\n\n  - This is different from the standard Needleman-Wunsch which uses a constant gap penalty per gap (or affine). We must implement accordingly.\n\n  - The recurrence for the dynamic programming matrix D[i][j] (for aligning sequence1[0..i-1] and sequence2[0..j-1]):\n\n        D[i][j] = max {\n            D[i-1][j-1] + substitution(seq1[i-1], seq2[j-1]),\n            D[i-1][j] + gap(seq1[i-1]),   // because we are deleting seq1[i-1] (so we use gap penalty for that amino acid)\n            D[i][j-1] + gap(seq2[j-1])    // because we are deleting seq2[j-1]\n        }\n\n  - But note: if we have a gap in sequence1 (meaning we are aligning a gap with an amino acid in sequence2), then we are effectively deleting the amino acid in sequence2? Actually, no: we are inserting a gap in sequence1 and aligning it with the amino acid in sequence2. The problem states that the gap penalty for an amino acid is the cost of deleting it. So when we skip an amino acid in sequence1 (to align with a gap), we use the gap penalty for that amino acid. Similarly for sequence2.\n\n  - However, the above recurrence would use the gap penalty for a single amino acid at a time. But if we have a gap of multiple amino acids, we are effectively charging the gap penalty for each amino acid skipped. This is a linear gap penalty, but with variable cost per position.\n\n  - We are not told that the gap penalty is affine (with separate opening and extension). So we assume linear.\n\n 6. We must be efficient: if we have n species, we will have to compute O(n^2) pairwise alignments. Each alignment is O(m*n) for sequences of length m and n. This can be heavy for long sequences and many species. But we are not asked to optimize at this point.\n\n 7. The algorithm must be implemented for two sequences and the scoring matrix. We will create a method that takes two sequences and the scoring matrix (which we will have loaded from the BLOSUM file) and returns the alignment score.\n\n 8. We must design the scoring matrix structure appropriately for fast lookups.\n\n 9. We are to use Java 21 and Maven. We will use a JSON library for parsing (like Jackson or Gson). Since we are using Maven, we can add the dependency.\n\n 10. We are to write production-ready code: handle exceptions, logging, etc.\n\n Summary of what we will do in the next step (code generation):\n\n  - Create a Maven project with the required dependencies (e.g., Jackson for JSON).\n  - Create a class to represent the scoring matrix (with two maps: one for single amino acids (gap penalties) and one for pairs (substitution scores). For pairs, we will store them in a way that we can look up by a canonical key (e.g., we sort the two characters alphabetically to form the key? But note: the matrix is symmetric, and the example gives both "ab" and "ba". We can decide to store the substitution scores in a Map<String, Integer> and then when we want to get the score for (x,y), we form a string of the two characters in sorted order? Or we can form a key by concatenating in any order and then when looking up, try both orders? Actually, the example says both are present and same value. But we can also preprocess: when loading the JSON, we can store for every unordered pair one key (the sorted one). Alternatively, we can note that the matrix is symmetric and the file provides both, but we can just store the first one we see? Actually, the example file has both. We can check for consistency? Or we can simply use the key as provided and then when querying, try both orders? \n\n  However, to be safe, we can design the scoring matrix class to have:\n\n        private final Map<Character, Integer> gapPenalties;\n        private final Map<String, Integer> substitutionScores;   // keys are two-character strings\n\n  Then, when we want to get the substitution score for (a, b), we try:\n        String key1 = "" + a + b;\n        String key2 = "" + b + a;\n        if (substitutionScores.containsKey(key1)) {\n            return substitutionScores.get(key1);\n        } else if (substitutionScores.containsKey(key2)) {\n            return substitutionScores.get(key2);\n        } else {\n            // what? According to the problem, the matrix should cover all amino acids? We might need to throw an exception?\n        }\n\n  But note: the example file also includes keys for two identical characters? Like "aa", "bb". So we can also have that. And we can use the same method.\n\n  Alternatively, we can preprocess the substitution map to a two-level map: Map<Character, Map<Character, Integer>>. Then we can do:\n\n        substitutionScores.get(a).get(b)\n\n  But the problem is that the file gives the keys as two-character strings. We can build a two-level map when loading.\n\n  Steps for loading the BLOSUM file:\n\n        Parse the JSON file into a Map<String, Integer> rawMap.\n\n        Then, for each entry in the rawMap:\n            - If the key length is 1: put into gapPenalties map: key.charAt(0) -> value.\n            - If the key length is 2: then we have two amino acids. We can store in a two-level map: \n                  substitutionScores.computeIfAbsent(key.charAt(0), k -> new HashMap<>()).put(key.charAt(1), value);\n                  // but also note: the matrix is symmetric? Actually, the value for (a,b) should be the same as (b,a). But the file might have both. So we can also store both? Or we can store one and then when building the two-level map, we can set both substitutionScores.get(a).put(b, value) and substitutionScores.get(b).put(a, value)? But wait, the example has both keys and same value. So if we store both, we are storing the same value twice? That\'s acceptable but redundant.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build a symmetric view: we store the value for (a,b) and then when we get (b,a) we return the same. We can do that by having a two-level map and ensuring that for every (a,b) we set both? But that would be inefficient in storage.\n\n        Or we can store in a single map with a key that is a pair (a,b) where we consider (a,b) and (b,a) the same. We can define a canonical representation: we store the pair with the smaller character first? Then when querying, we sort the two characters.\n\n        I think the canonical representation (sorted) is better.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if (key.length() == 2) {\n                char c1 = key.charAt(0);\n                char c2 = key.charAt(1);\n                // create a canonical key: sort the two characters\n                String canonical = c1 <= c2 ? "" + c1 + c2 : "" + c2 + c1;\n                // then store in a map: canonicalScores.put(canonical, value);\n            }\n\n        Then when we want to get the substitution score for (a, b), we form the canonical key and get from canonicalScores.\n\n        But note: what if the matrix has both "ab" and "ba" with different values? Then we would overwrite? We should check: the example says both are the same. So we can assume consistency? Or we can check and log a warning?\n\n        Since this is production code, we can check when loading: if we already have a canonical key and we are about to put a different value, we throw an exception.\n\n 11. We will create:\n\n        - A class `ScoringMatrix` that holds:\n             Map<Character, Integer> gapPenalties\n             Map<String, Integer> substitutionScores   // using canonical keys? Or we can have a method to get the substitution score for two chars.\n\n        But we can also have:\n\n             public int getGapPenalty(char aminoAcid) \n             public int getSubstitutionScore(char a, char b)\n\n        And internally, the substitution score is stored in a map with canonical keys? Or we can use a two-level map? Actually, the two-level map is faster? But we have to build it.\n\n        Let\'s do:\n\n            private final Map<Character, Integer> gapPenaltyMap;\n            private final Map<Character, Map<Character, Integer>> substitutionScoreMap;\n\n        How to build substitutionScoreMap from the raw JSON map for two-character keys?\n\n            for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : rawMap.entrySet()) {\n                String key = entry.getKey();\n                if (key.length() == 1) {\n                    // add to gapPenaltyMap\n                } else if (key.length() == 2) {\n                    char c1 = key.charAt(0);\n                    char c2 = key.charAt(1);\n                    // We will put in both directions? Actually, we can store for (c1, c2) and (c2, c1) separately? But the matrix is symmetric? Actually, the value is the same for both. However, we are told that the file has both? But we are reading from the file and we get each key. We can store:\n\n                    substitutionScoreMap.computeIfAbsent(c1, k -> new HashMap<>()).put(c2, entry.getValue());\n                    substitutionScoreMap.computeIfAbsent(c2, k -> new HashMap<>()).put(c1, entry.getValue());\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then, in `getSubstitutionScore(char a, char b)`:\n\n            Map<Character, Integer> inner = substitutionScoreMap.get(a);\n            if (inner == null) {\n                // maybe there is no entry for a? Then we look for b? Actually, we should have all amino acids covered? We can throw an exception?\n                // Alternatively, we can have a default? But the problem doesn\'t specify. We should throw a meaningful exception.\n            } else {\n                Integer score = inner.get(b);\n                if (score == null) {\n                    // throw an exception? Or we can have a default? The problem doesn\'t say. We should throw.\n                }\n                return score;\n            }\n\n        But note: what if we get a character that is not in the gapPenaltyMap? Similarly, we should throw.\n\n 12. We\'ll also need to read the organisms.json and blosumXX.json from the current directory (or a subfolder? The problem says: start from current directory and use subfolders. So we can have the input files in the current directory? Or we can have a configuration? We\'ll just read from the current directory for now.\n\n 13. We\'ll create a class for the alignment algorithm.\n\n 14. We\'ll create a main class that orchestrates the reading of files, loading the scoring matrix, then for each pair of species, compute the score and build the similarity matrix.\n\n However, the current task is only the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. We are not asked for the entire pipeline yet? The problem says: "the first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm". So we focus on that.\n\n But note: the problem says "Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used".

## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from ‚Äúorganism.json‚Äù calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in ‚ÄúblosumXX.json‚Äù file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string ‚Äúaabaab‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies1‚Äù and another string ‚Äúababaa‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies2‚Äù, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to create a Java program that:\n 1. Reads a BLOSUM matrix from a JSON file (either blosum50.json or blosum62.json) into a data structure.\n 2. Reads a set of species and their amino acid sequences from organisms.json.\n 3. For every pair of species, computes the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score using the provided BLOSUM matrix for substitution scores and the single character keys for gap penalties (which are the costs for deleting a character, i.e., gap penalty).\n 4. The gap penalty is taken from the BLOSUM JSON for a single character. Note that the gap penalty is constant per gap (we are using linear gap penalty). The problem states that a single character key (like "a") represents the cost of deleting that character. However, note that in standard Needleman-Wunsch, we have a constant gap penalty. Since the gap penalty should be the same regardless of the amino acid, we assume that the gap penalty is the same for every amino acid? But the example file has different values for \'a\' and \'b\'. \n\n However, the problem says: "key is of type string and value is numerical. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character". But in practice, for a gap we don\'t have an amino acid to delete? So we must interpret: \n - When we have a gap in sequence A (meaning we are inserting a gap in A and aligning a character in B to the gap), we use the gap penalty for that character in B? But that would be inconsistent because the gap penalty would then depend on the amino acid in the other sequence.\n\n Let me clarify with the example: \n   In the example BLOSUM: {"a":-1, "b":-2, ...}\n   This means:\n      - If we have a gap in sequence A and the current character in sequence B is \'a\', then the cost is -1 (which is a penalty of 1, because we are subtracting? Actually, note: in the example, the score for matching \'a\' to \'a\' is 2, which is positive. So we want to maximize the score. A gap penalty should be negative to penalize.\n\n However, the standard Needleman-Wunsch uses a constant gap penalty. We must follow the specification: the gap penalty for a gap in a sequence is determined by the amino acid in the other sequence? That seems odd.\n\n But note the problem: "deleting that character" - meaning if we delete an \'a\', we get a penalty of -1. So when we have a gap in one sequence, we are effectively deleting the corresponding character in the other sequence? Actually, no: in the alignment, a gap in sequence A at a position means we are skipping that position in A and we have a character in B. So we are not deleting the character in B, we are aligning it to a gap. The penalty for that gap should be the penalty for the gap itself. \n\n However, the problem states that the single character key represents the cost of deleting that character. In alignment, when we have a gap in sequence A, we are effectively deleting a character from A? No, we are inserting a gap in A. The terminology is confusing.\n\n Let me re-read: "deleting that character" - that sounds like we are removing an amino acid and not replacing it? So that would be the gap penalty. And note that in the example, the gap penalty for \'a\' is -1 and for \'b\' is -2. So we have a gap penalty that depends on the amino acid that is being "deleted" (i.e., the amino acid in the sequence that is not gapped). \n\n Therefore, when we have:\n   - A gap in sequence A: we are aligning a character from B to a gap -> we use the gap penalty for the character in B (because we are effectively deleting B\'s character? or rather, we are not matching it to anything). But wait, the problem says: "deleting that character", so if we are in sequence B and we have a gap in A, then we are not deleting a character in B? We are keeping it but without a match. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the gap penalty is taken from the amino acid that is adjacent to the gap? But the example does not specify.\n\n However, the example test case: \n   Sequence1: "aabaab"\n   Sequence2: "ababaa"\n   BLOSUM: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}\n\n How do we compute the score?\n\n We note that the example says the output should be 7.\n\n Let me do a small alignment by hand:\n\n   One possible alignment (with global alignment) that might yield 7:\n\n   Sequence1: a a b a a b\n   Sequence2: a b a b a a\n\n   But that doesn\'t align perfectly. Alternatively:\n\n   We can try:\n\n      a a b a a b\n      a b a b a a\n\n   This has mismatches at positions 2,3,4,5? Let\'s compute:\n\n   Position1: a vs a -> score for "aa": 2\n   Position2: a vs b -> score for "ab": -3\n   Position3: b vs a -> score for "ba": -3\n   Position4: a vs b -> score for "ab": -3\n   Position5: a vs a -> 2\n   Position6: b vs a -> -3\n\n   Total: 2 -3 -3 -3 +2 -3 = -8 -> not 7.\n\n   Alternatively, we might introduce gaps? \n\n   Another alignment:\n\n      a a b a a b -\n      a - b a b a a\n\n   Now let\'s break it:\n\n      a vs a: 2\n      a vs gap: gap penalty for \'a\'? -> -1 (because the next in sequence2 is gap, so we are deleting the \'a\' in sequence1? But the gap is in sequence2, so we are aligning a character in sequence1 to a gap -> we use the gap penalty for the character in sequence1? which is \'a\' -> -1.\n\n      Then we have: \n        a (seq1) vs gap: -1\n        Then we have: \n          b (seq1) vs b (seq2): 3? \n        Then a vs a: 2\n        Then a vs b: -3\n        Then b vs a: -3\n        Then gap vs a: gap penalty for \'a\'? -1\n\n   Total: 2 (a-a) + (-1) (a-gap) + 3 (b-b) + 2 (a-a) + (-3) (a-b) + (-3) (b-a) + (-1) (gap-a) = 2 -1 + 3 + 2 -3 -3 -1 = -1 -> not 7.\n\n   Alternatively, we might have:\n\n      a a b a a b\n      a b a b a a\n\n   Without gaps? Then we get the -8 as above.\n\n   How about:\n\n      a a b a a b\n      a b - b a a\n\n   Then:\n      a vs a: 2\n      a vs b: -3\n      b vs gap: gap penalty for \'b\'? -2\n      a vs b: -3\n      a vs a: 2\n      b vs a: -3\n\n   Total: 2 -3 -2 -3 +2 -3 = -7\n\n   Still not 7.\n\n   Alternatively, the example might have a different alignment? \n\n   After rechecking: the example input is "aabaab" and "ababaa". Note that the example says the output should be 7.\n\n   I found that the example might be computed without considering the gap penalty as a separate issue? Or maybe I misunderstood the scoring.\n\n   Let me compute the example using the standard Needleman-Wunsch with the given scoring:\n\n   We have:\n     gap penalty: but note, the gap penalty is not constant? It depends on the amino acid? Actually, the problem says: the cost of deleting a character. In the alignment, when we have a gap, we are effectively deleting one character from one of the sequences? So the gap penalty for a gap in sequence1 (which means we are deleting a character from sequence1) would be the value for that character? But that character is the one that is skipped? Actually, no: we are skipping a character in sequence1, so we are deleting that character. So if we skip an \'a\' in sequence1, we use the gap penalty of -1 (for \'a\'). Similarly, if we skip a \'b\', we use -2.\n\n   However, in the alignment, we don\'t know which amino acid we are skipping until we know which sequence we are gapping? \n\n   The standard Needleman-Wunsch algorithm uses a constant gap penalty. Here we have a gap penalty that is amino acid specific? \n\n   How to handle:\n\n   We can define:\n     gap_penalty(character) = the value from the BLOSUM for that single character.\n\n   But note: in the alignment, when we have a gap in sequence1 at a position, we are skipping an amino acid in sequence1? Actually, no: the gap is introduced and we are not skipping a particular amino acid? The gap is inserted and the amino acid that was supposed to be aligned is now aligned to a gap? So the gap penalty should be associated with the amino acid that is in the sequence that has the gap? But the gap doesn\'t have an amino acid.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean that the gap penalty is constant and is given by the value for a special key? But the example does not have a special key.\n\n   After re-reading: the example BLOSUM has keys: "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa", "bb". So we have two types of keys: single letter (for gap) and two letters (for substitution). \n\n   Therefore, in the algorithm:\n\n     When we align two characters c1 and c2, we look up the key c1+c2? But note: the example has both "ab" and "ba", so order matters? Actually, the example has both, but they have the same value? \n\n   However, the problem says: "swapping \'a\' for \'b\' or \'b\' for \'a\' cost -3". So the matrix is symmetric? Then we can assume that the key for substitution is the concatenation in any order? But the file has two separate keys. \n\n   How should we handle? The problem says the key is a string. For a substitution, we have two possible keys: "ab" and "ba". But they are both present and have the same value? So we can use either? Actually, we must use the key that matches the two characters in the order of the two sequences? \n\n   However, the example does not specify the order. But note: the sequences are from two species, and we are aligning sequence1 (from species1) to sequence2 (from species2). So for position i, we have character c1 from sequence1 and c2 from sequence2. Then we look up the key c1+c2? \n\n   But the example file has both "ab" and "ba". So we must use the key that is the concatenation of the two characters in the order: first character from sequence1 and then sequence2? \n\n   The example: \n        sequence1: "aabaab"\n        sequence2: "ababaa"\n\n   For the first pair: (a, a) -> key "aa" -> 2.\n   Second: (a, b) -> key "ab" -> -3.\n   Third: (b, a) -> key "ba" -> -3.\n   Fourth: (a, b) -> -3.\n   Fifth: (a, a) -> 2.\n   Sixth: (b, a) -> -3.\n\n   Total: 2 -3 -3 -3 +2 -3 = -8.\n\n   But the example says the output should be 7.\n\n   This indicates that the example might be using a different alignment? Or the scoring might be defined differently.\n\n   Alternatively, the example might have a gap penalty? \n\n   How about we try an alignment with gaps? \n\n   Let me try:\n\n      sequence1: a a b a a b\n      sequence2: a b a b a a\n\n   This is without gaps -> -8.\n\n   Another alignment:\n\n      sequence1: a a b a a b\n      sequence2: a b a b a a   -> same as above.\n\n   How about:\n\n      sequence1: a a b a a b\n      sequence2: a b a b a a   -> same.\n\n   Or:\n\n      sequence1: a a b a a b\n      sequence2: a b a b a a   -> no gaps.\n\n   How can we get 7? \n\n   I suspect the example test case might have been miscalculated? Or the scoring interpretation is different.\n\n   Alternatively, the example BLOSUM might be used in a different way: \n\n   The problem says: \n        Example structure of the blosum.json: ```{‚Äúa‚Äù: -1, ‚Äúb‚Äù: -2, ‚Äúab‚Äù: -3, ‚Äúba": -3, ‚Äúaa‚Äù: 2, ‚Äúbb‚Äù: 3} ```\n\n   But note: the example does not have an entry for every possible pair? What about if we have a gap? \n\n   We have two sequences: \n        s1 = "aabaab"\n        s2 = "ababaa"\n\n   Let me try an alignment with gaps:\n\n        s1: a a b a a b\n        s2: a b - b a a\n\n        Then:\n          a vs a: 2\n          a vs b: -3\n          b vs gap: we use the gap penalty for the character in the sequence that has the gap? In this case, the gap is in s2, so we are skipping a character in s2? But the gap penalty is defined for deleting a character? So if we skip a character in s2, we are deleting a character from s2? Then we look at the next character in s2 that we are skipping? Actually, we are not skipping a specific character? The gap is inserted and we are aligning the \'b\' in s1 to a gap. So we are deleting the \'b\' in s1? No, we are aligning the \'b\' in s1 to a gap in s2. Then the gap penalty should be for the character in s1? Because we are effectively not matching the \'b\' in s1 to anything? So we use the gap penalty for \'b\': -2.\n\n        Then we have:\n          a vs b: -3   (next: s1[3]=\'a\' and s2[2]=\'b\') -> note: we skipped the \'a\' in s2? Actually, we skipped the \'a\' in s2? But we are at the third character of s1 and the second character of s2? \n\n        Actually, the alignment:\n\n          s1[0] = \'a\' -> s2[0] = \'a\'\n          s1[1] = \'a\' -> s2[1] = \'b\'\n          s1[2] = \'b\' -> gap in s2 (so we skip s2[2] which is \'a\') -> then we are aligning s1[2] to gap -> penalty for \'b\'? -2.\n          Then we have s1[3] = \'a\' and s2[2] = \'a\'? But wait, we skipped s2[2]? Then we move to s2[3]=\'b\'? So s1[3]=\'a\' and s2[3]=\'b\' -> -3.\n          s1[4]=\'a\' and s2[4]=\'a\' -> 2\n          s1[5]=\'b\' and s2[5]=\'a\' -> -3\n\n        Total: 2 (a-a) + (-3) (a-b) + (-2) (b-gap) + (-3) (a-b) + 2 (a-a) + (-3) (b-a) = 2-3-2-3+2-3 = -7.\n\n   Still not 7.\n\n   Another possibility: the gap penalty is taken from the character in the sequence that is not gapped? For example, when we have a gap in s2, we are aligning the character in s1 to a gap, and the penalty is the value for that character in s1? That\'s what I did above.\n\n   But the example test case says the output should be 7.\n\n   I suspect there might be an error in the example. However, the problem states the example test case and expected output. We must produce 7.\n\n   Let me try to compute the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm by hand for the example with the given scoring, and see if there\'s an alignment that yields 7.\n\n   We\'ll use dynamic programming:\n\n   Sequences:\n      s1 = "aabaab"\n      s2 = "ababaa"\n\n   We\'ll create a DP table.\n\n   Let m = length of s1 = 6, n = length of s2 = 6.\n\n   Scoring:\n      match: \n          aa: 2, bb: 3, ab: -3, ba: -3\n      gap: \n          for \'a\': -1, for \'b\': -2\n\n   How to handle gap penalty? \n      If we have a gap in s1 (meaning we are aligning a gap in s1 to a character c in s2), then we use gap penalty for c? \n      Or if we have a gap in s2 (meaning we are aligning a character c in s1 to a gap), then we use gap penalty for c?\n\n   The problem says: "deleting that character". So if we have a gap in s1, we are effectively deleting the character in s2? That doesn\'t make sense. \n\n   Alternatively, we interpret:\n      - When we skip a character in s1 (i.e., we have a gap in s1), we are deleting that character from s1? But we don\'t have a character to delete? We are at the gap, and the character in s1 that we are skipping is the one we are at? \n\n   Actually, the standard interpretation is that the gap penalty is independent of the character. But here it is character-specific.\n\n   We have two possibilities:\n\n      Possibility 1: \n          When we have a gap in s1 (so we are using a character from s2 and skipping a character in s1), then the gap penalty is the penalty for the character in s1 that we are skipping? But we don\'t know what character we are skipping because we are not aligning it? \n\n      Possibility 2:\n          When we have a gap in s1, we are aligning a character from s2 to a gap, and the penalty'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 2499, 'total_tokens': 6595, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2176}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2176, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 323}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'f10c098a-d059-444e-ab4c-079e5a755f73', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--ae96fa11-5fa8-44e3-833f-2a7bb64f7f51-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2499, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 6595, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2176}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using ‚Äú_‚Äù, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to modify the previous solution to include saving the similarity scores to a JSON file.\n Steps:\n 1. We already have a method to compute the Needleman-Wunsch score for two sequences and a scoring function.\n 2. We have a class `SimilarityCalculator` that reads the organisms and the BLOSUM matrix, then computes the pairwise scores and stores them in a `Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>` (a matrix of species vs species).\n 3. Now, we want to write this matrix to a JSON file in a flattened form: each key is "species1_species2" and the value is the integer score.\n\n However, note that the requirement is to save in a key-value structure where the key is the concatenation of the two species names with an underscore.\n But note: the similarity matrix is symmetric? Actually, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm we implemented is symmetric? \n We have implemented it for two sequences and the algorithm itself is symmetric if the substitution matrix is symmetric (which BLOSUM is). \n However, in our storage, we have stored for every pair (i, j) and (j, i) the same value? Actually, we computed for every unordered pair? \n\n But note: the requirement says "for each pair of species". We don\'t want duplicates. We can write each pair only once? However, the requirement does not specify order, but the key is "species1_species2". \n We must decide on an order? The problem says: "keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using ‚Äú_‚Äù". It doesn\'t specify which one first. \n We can do it in alphabetical order? Or just for every unordered pair we generate one key? \n\n However, the problem does not specify if the pair (A,B) should be the same as (B,A). Since the score is symmetric, we can choose an order. \n Let\'s choose lexicographical order for the species names to form the key. So for two species, we sort the names and then concatenate? \n\n But note: the example output file name: "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json". The XX is the same as in the input BLOSUM file.\n\n How to get the XX? We are reading from a BLOSUM file named "blosumXX.json". We can extract the XX from the filename? \n\n However, in the previous code, we read the BLOSUM file from a path provided by the user. We can pass the BLOSUM filename to the SimilarityCalculator and then use that to form the output filename.\n\n Alternatively, we can have the BLOSUM filename as an input to the program? Actually, in the main method we are passing the paths. We can extract the XX from the BLOSUM file path.\n\n But note: the requirement says: "save the results to file called \'organisms_scores_blosumXX.json\'".\n\n We are going to do:\n\n   String blosumFilename = ... // the filename without path, e.g., "blosum50.json"\n   String suffix = blosumFilename.replace("blosum", "").replace(".json", "");\n   String outputFilename = "organisms_scores_blosum" + suffix + ".json";\n\n However, what if the path is provided with directories? We should extract the base filename.\n\n Alternatively, we can require that the BLOSUM file is given as a simple filename (without path) or we can handle paths.\n\n Since the requirement says: "If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders", we are reading from the current directory? \n\n Actually, the input files are provided as relative paths. We can assume that the BLOSUM file is in the current directory? Or we can extract the base name from the path.\n\n Let\'s use: \n   Path blosumPath = Paths.get(blosumFilePath);\n   String blosumFileName = blosumPath.getFileName().toString();\n\n Then we can extract the XX.\n\n But note: the example: "blosum50.json" -> we want to get "50". We can do:\n\n   String blosumType = blosumFileName.replace("blosum", "").replace(".json", "");\n\n Then output file: "organisms_scores_blosum" + blosumType + ".json"\n\n However, what if the file is named differently? We must assume that the input BLOSUM file is named exactly as "blosumXX.json".\n\n We\'ll do:\n\n   if (blosumFileName.startsWith("blosum") && blosumFileName.endsWith(".json")) {\n        blosumType = blosumFileName.substring(6, blosumFileName.length() - 5);\n   }\n\n But let\'s be safe: we can use regex? But for simplicity, we assume the naming.\n\n Alternatively, we can pass the BLOSUM type as a parameter? But the requirement says we are using two different types: 50 and 62. And the file name indicates it.\n\n We\'ll extract as above.\n\n Steps for writing the JSON:\n\n   We have a map: Map<String, Map<String, Integer>> similarityMatrix. We want to create a Map<String, Integer> for the pairs.\n\n   We\'ll create a new map: Map<String, Integer> pairScores = new HashMap<>();\n\n   for (String species1 : speciesList) {\n        for (String species2 : speciesList) {\n            // We want to avoid duplicate pairs? Actually, we have a full matrix including both (i,j) and (j,i) and also (i,i). \n            // But the requirement is to have for each pair? It doesn\'t say distinct pairs? \n            // However, the example key is "testspecies1_testspecies2", so we are including every ordered pair? \n            // But note: the problem says "for each pair of species" - which typically means unordered? However, the example output key is built by concatenation without specifying order.\n\n            // But the requirement: "keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using ‚Äú_‚Äù" - it doesn\'t specify order. \n            // We must be consistent. We can do:\n\n            // Option 1: include both (A,B) and (B,A) -> but that would be redundant because the score is the same? \n            // However, the example output file is a key-value structure, and keys must be unique. So we cannot have two keys for the same pair in different order.\n\n            // Therefore, we must choose an order. We can choose to always write the pair in lexicographical order? \n\n            // But the requirement does not specify. Let\'s re-read: "keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using ‚Äú_‚Äù". \n            // It doesn\'t say which one first. So we can decide. We\'ll do lexicographical order.\n\n            // However, note: the example input has "Wild boar" and "Horse". Lexicographically: "Horse" < "Wild boar", so key would be "Horse_Wild boar".\n\n            // But what if we have three species? We want to avoid duplicate keys? We\'ll generate one key per unordered pair.\n\n            // So: for each unordered pair (i, j) with i < j (lexicographically) and also include the same species? (i,i) is also a pair? \n\n            // The problem says "for each pair of species". It doesn\'t say distinct? But typically, we do include the same species? \n            // Actually, the Needleman-Wunsch of a sequence with itself should be the best score.\n\n            // However, the requirement for the output file does not specify. We can include all pairs? including (i,i). \n\n            // But note: the example test case: two species only.\n\n            // However, for the phylogenetic tree, we need a complete matrix? But the tree building algorithm might require a full matrix? \n\n            // But the requirement for saving: we are saving a key-value structure. We can include every pair (i,j) for i and j, but we must generate a unique key. \n\n            // We can do: \n            //   key = species1 + "_" + species2   for every ordered pair? But then we have both (A,B) and (B,A) and they are the same? \n            //   But the score is symmetric? So we can save both? But that would be redundant? \n\n            // However, the problem does not specify. We are going to save for every unordered pair only once? \n\n            // But note: the problem says "each pair of species", meaning every distinct unordered pair? \n\n            // However, the example: they have one pair: "testspecies1_testspecies2". \n\n            // We\'ll do: for every pair (i, j) where i and j are taken from the set of species, we generate a key by:\n            //   if i <= j lexicographically, then key = i + "_" + j, else key = j + "_" + i? \n            // But then we have the same key for (i,j) and (j,i). \n\n            // Actually, we don\'t want to duplicate. We\'ll generate one key per unordered pair. We can do:\n\n            //   String key;\n            //   if (species1.compareTo(species2) <= 0) {\n            //       key = species1 + "_" + species2;\n            //   } else {\n            //       key = species2 + "_" + species1;\n            //   }\n\n            // But note: what about (i,i)? Then species1.equals(species2) -> key = species1 + "_" + species1.\n\n            // This is acceptable.\n\n            // However, we are iterating over every pair? We are currently iterating over every ordered pair. We can avoid duplicate keys by using a Set of pairs? \n            // But we are generating the key in a canonical order so that (i,j) and (j,i) become the same key.\n\n            // But wait: we are going to put the same key multiple times? We must avoid putting the same key twice? \n\n            // Actually, we are iterating over every ordered pair. For an unordered pair (i,j) we will generate the same key twice? \n            // For (i,j): when i<=j -> key1 = i_j\n            // For (j,i): when j>=i -> then we compare: j and i -> if j>=i, then we form key = i_j? because if j>=i then we do the same? \n            // Actually, we are comparing the same two strings. So for (i,j) and (j,i) we form the same key? \n\n            // Therefore, we will put the same key twice? That would overwrite? So we are safe? \n\n            // However, we don\'t need to do two times? We can do:\n\n            //   for (int i = 0; i < speciesList.size(); i++) {\n            //       for (int j = i; j < speciesList.size(); j++) {\n            //           ... \n            //       }\n            //   }\n\n            // But the requirement does not specify which pairs to include. We are going to include every unordered pair? including (i,i)? \n\n            // However, the problem says "each pair of species", which typically includes (i,i)? \n\n            // But the example output file does not specify. We\'ll include all pairs? \n\n            // However, the example test case: two species -> we have three pairs: (testspecies1, testspecies1), (testspecies1, testspecies2), (testspecies2, testspecies2). \n\n            // But the example output key is "testspecies1_testspecies2", so they are only asking for the distinct species? \n\n            // Let me re-read: "for each pair of species from ‚Äúorganism.json‚Äù" - it doesn\'t say distinct. So we should do every pair? meaning for every two species (including the same one twice). \n\n            // So we do:\n\n            //   for every species1 in the set of species:\n            //      for every species2 in the set of species:\n\n            // Then we form the key in canonical order? and then we put the score.\n\n            // But note: we are storing the full matrix in memory. Then we are writing a flattened version? \n\n            // How many pairs? n^2. It\'s acceptable for moderate n? \n\n            // We\'ll do:\n\n            //   Map<String, Integer> pairScores = new HashMap<>();\n            //   for (String s1 : organisms.keySet()) {\n            //        for (String s2 : organisms.keySet()) {\n            //            String key = (s1.compareTo(s2) <= 0 ? s1 + "_" + s2 : s2 + "_" + s1;\n            //            int score = similarityMatrix.get(s1).get(s2);\n            //            pairScores.put(key, score);\n            //        }\n            //   }\n\n            // But note: the similarityMatrix is stored as a nested map: for s1, we have a map of s2->score.\n\n        }\n   }\n\n 4. Then we write the map `pairScores` to a JSON file.\n\n 5. We\'ll use Jackson for JSON writing? We are already using Jackson for reading.\n\n 6. We must update the main method to write the file.\n\n 7. We\'ll create a utility method to write the map to a JSON file.\n\n 8. We must handle IOExceptions.\n\n 9. We must extract the BLOSUM type from the BLOSUM filename to form the output filename.\n\n Let\'s update the code:\n\n We are going to:\n\n   - In the `SimilarityCalculator` class, we already have a method `calculateSimilarityMatrix` that returns the matrix (nested map).\n\n   - We\'ll add a method to write the matrix to a JSON file in the flattened form.\n\n   - We\'ll update the main method to call this writer.\n\n 10. We\'ll create a class `SimilarityWriter` or put the writing method in `SimilarityCalculator`? \n\n     We can add:\n\n        public static void writeSimilarityMatrixToJson(Map<String, Map<String, Integer>> matrix, String outputFile) throws IOException {\n            // Create the flattened map\n            Map<String, Integer> flattened = new HashMap<>();\n            for (String s1 : matrix.keySet()) {\n                Map<String, Integer> row = matrix.get(s1);\n                for (String s2 : row.keySet()) {\n                    String key = s1.compareTo(s2) <= 0 ? s1 + "_" + s2 : s2 + "_" + s1;\n                    flattened.put(key, row.get(s2));\n                }\n            }\n            // Write the map to the file\n            ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n            mapper.writeValue(new File(outputFile), flattened);\n        }\n\n 11. Then in the main method, after we compute the matrix, we write it:\n\n        String blosumType = ... // extracted from the blosumFilePath\n        String outputFilename = "organisms_scores_blosum" + blosumType + ".json";\n        writeSimilarityMatrixToJson(similarityMatrix, outputFilename);\n\n 12. How to extract the blosumType? We can do:\n\n        // Extract the BLOSUM type from the blosum file path\n        Path blosumPath = Paths.get(blosumFilePath);\n        String blosumFileName = blosumPath.getFileName().toString();\n        // Remove the prefix "blosum" and the suffix ".json"\n        String blosumType = blosumFileName.substring(6, blosumFileName.length() - 5);\n\n        // But we must check the format. We assume the filename is exactly "blosumXX.json"\n\n 13. We\'ll add error handling for the filename? We can do:\n\n        if (!blosumFileName.startsWith("blosum") || !blosumFileName.endsWith(".json")) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException("BLOSUM file name must be in the format \'blosumXX.json\'");\n        }\n        blosumType = blosumFileName.substring(6, blosumFileName.length() - 5);\n\n 14. Alternatively, we can use a regex? But for now, we assume.\n\n Let\'s update the main method in `Main` class.\n\n 15. We must note: the current code does not have the flattened map for the entire matrix? We are storing the full matrix? \n\n     Actually, our `SimilarityCalculator` already computes the full matrix (for every ordered pair). \n\n 16. However, we are storing the matrix as a nested map: for each species1, we have a map of species2->score. \n\n 17. We\'ll update the main method accordingly.\n\n 18. We must be cautious: the flattened map we are creating in `writeSimilarityMatrixToJson` will have n^2 entries? But we are storing each unordered pair only once? \n\n     Actually, no: because we are using the canonical key (by lex order) and we are iterating over every ordered pair. But the same canonical key will be used for (i,j) and (j,i). So we are overwriting? \n\n     But note: the score for (i,j) and (j,i) is the same? Yes. So it doesn\'t matter.\n\n 19. However, we are including every pair (i,j) exactly once? Actually, we are including every unordered pair? But we are iterating over every ordered pair and then using a canonical key. So we are putting the same key multiple times? \n\n     For a given unordered pair (i,j) (with i != j), we will have two iterations: \n        (i,j) -> key = i_j (if i<j) -> then we put (i_j, score)\n        (j,i) -> key = i_j (because j>i, then we form i_j) -> then we put (i_j, score) again -> same key, so overwrite.\n\n     So we are writing the same value twice? That\'s inefficient? But n is not too large? \n\n     Alternatively, we can iterate only over the upper triangle? But then we would miss the diagonal? \n\n     Actually, we are including the diagonal (i,i) only once? \n\n     We can change the loops to avoid duplicate keys? But the code is simpler as above. We\'ll leave it.\n\n 20. We\'ll update the code accordingly.\n\n 21. Also, note: the requirement says: "those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers". We are using integers.\n\n 22. We\'ll update the code.\n\n 23. We must update the `pom.xml` to include Jackson for JSON processing? We already have it.\n\n 24. We are going to write the flattened map to the file.\n\n 25. We must create the output file in the current directory? Yes.\n\n Implementation:\n\n We\'ll create a new method in the `Main` class for writing? Or we can put it in a separate utility? \n\n Since we are following clean code, we\'ll create a separate class for I/O operations? \n\n Alternatively, we can put the writing method in the `SimilarityCalculator`? \n\n But the `SimilarityCalculator` is already doing the calculation. We\'ll create a new class `SimilarityWriter` to handle the writing? \n\n However, the requirement is small, so we can put it in the `Main'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 2712, 'total_tokens': 6808, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2496}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2496, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 216}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'd6d29563-ce5c-41fc-af0f-cc618de50032', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--c3a2d30c-b163-4bd1-a758-593b2e2f00a0-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2712, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 6808, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2496}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are given the following:\n 1. We have a symmetric matrix of similarity scores (Needleman-Wunsch scores) for every pair of species.\n 2. We want to build a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering method that uses similarity (not distance). \n    Since most algorithms work with distances, we note:\n        - Higher similarity means the species are closer (so we can convert similarity to distance by taking negative or using a transformation, but note: \n          the problem states that we must operate on similarity scores because the later steps will use the raw scores for thresholding).\n 3. The method specified is single linkage, but note: single linkage typically uses the minimum distance (or maximum similarity) between clusters.\n\n However, the problem says: \n    "merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score"\n\n This is equivalent to: \n    - We start with each species in its own cluster.\n    - At each step, we find the two clusters (which can be single species or merged clusters) that have the highest similarity between any two elements in the two clusters (this is single linkage: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any pair of elements from each cluster).\n\n But note: the problem says that we are to use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores and that the tree must be built in a way that later we can use the raw scores for thresholding.\n\n Important: The tree we build will have internal nodes that represent the similarity score at which the merge happened. This similarity score will be used for thresholding.\n\n Steps for hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) with single linkage and similarity:\n   - We start with n clusters (each species is a cluster).\n   - We have a similarity matrix S of size n x n (symmetric, and we ignore the diagonal in the merging step).\n   - While there is more than one cluster:\n        a. Find the two clusters (i and j) with the maximum similarity value S[i][j] (over all pairs of clusters).\n        b. Merge these two clusters into a new cluster, k.\n        c. Update the similarity matrix by computing the similarity between the new cluster k and every other existing cluster. For single linkage, the similarity between cluster k and another cluster l is the maximum similarity between any element in k and any element in l.\n\n However, note: we are building a tree. We need to record the order of merging and the similarity at which the merge occurred.\n\n Representation of the tree:\n   - Each leaf node is a species (with name and the original sequence? but for the tree we only need the name and the score at the leaf is not used in merging?).\n   - Each internal node represents a merge event and has:\n        - The similarity score at which the merge happened (the similarity that caused the merge, which is the maximum similarity between any two elements from the two clusters being merged).\n        - The two children (which can be leaves or other internal nodes).\n        - The height of the node (in a dendrogram) is typically the similarity (or distance) at which the merge happens. Here, we want the similarity.\n\n But note: the problem says that we will later need to output in Newick format and draw a dendrogram. Also, we will cut the tree at similarity thresholds.\n\n Important: The similarity scores are raw and we are to use the same scores for thresholding. So when we cut the tree at a threshold T, we would get clusters by cutting the tree at the point where the similarity (the value at the internal node) is T. However, note that the tree is built by merging from the bottom (leaves) up (root). The root will have the smallest similarity (because we merge the least similar clusters last). Actually, the similarity values might decrease as we go up? But wait: we are merging the two clusters with the highest similarity first. So the first merge has the highest similarity, and then the next merge has a similarity that is at most as high as the first (because we take the maximum similarity between clusters, and after merging, the similarities to other clusters might be lower). \n\n However, note: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two elements (one from each cluster). So when we merge two clusters, the similarity to a third cluster might be higher than the similarity that caused the merge? Actually, no: because we are always merging the two clusters with the highest similarity. The next step will then pick the next highest similarity.\n\n But note: the similarity matrix for clusters is updated at each step. The similarity between the new cluster and other clusters is computed as the maximum similarity between any element of the new cluster and any element of the other cluster. This value might be higher than the similarity that caused the merge? Actually, no: because the merge was done for the two clusters that had the highest similarity. However, it might be that the similarity between the new cluster and a third cluster is the same as the similarity that was present between one of the merged clusters and the third cluster (if that was the maximum). \n\n We must design the tree so that each internal node has:\n   - The two children (left and right)\n   - The similarity score at which the merge happened (the value that was the maximum between the two clusters at the time of merge).\n\n The leaves do not have a similarity score? Actually, the leaves are the species and we don\'t have a similarity for a leaf by itself. But in the tree, the leaf is at the bottom. The first merge happens at a similarity score S1, then the next at S2 (<= S1), and so on.\n\n How to represent the tree? We can have a class `PhylogeneticTree` and a class `Node` (which can be `LeafNode` or `InternalNode`). Alternatively, we can have one `Node` class that can represent both.\n\n Let\'s define:\n   - `Node`:\n        - `name`: for leaf nodes, the species name; for internal nodes, we can generate a name (like "Node1") or leave it as null? Actually, in Newick format, internal nodes can have names but they are optional. We care about the branch lengths? Actually, in Newick we typically have branch lengths. But note: our tree is built with similarity scores at the merge events. \n\n However, note: the problem does not specify branch lengths. It says we will draw a dendrogram. In a dendrogram, the horizontal axis typically represents the similarity (or distance) at which the merge occurs. The vertical axis is arbitrary (ordering of leaves).\n\n For the Newick format, we can represent the tree as:\n   - A leaf: `species_name`\n   - An internal node: `(child1, child2):branch_length?` ... but note: we haven\'t defined branch lengths. \n\n Actually, the problem says: "branch lengths reflect evolutionary distance". But in our case, we have similarity, not distance. We can convert similarity to distance? But the problem says we must use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores for the tree building and thresholding.\n\n How do we assign branch lengths? \n   - The problem does not specify. In fact, the task now is to build the tree structure (the topology) and record the similarity at which each merge occurs. The branch lengths in the dendrogram might be represented by the similarity value at the merge event. But note: in a dendrogram, the horizontal position of the merge is the similarity. \n\n For the purpose of the tree structure, we can store at each internal node the similarity score of the merge. Then, when writing to Newick, we can use that score as the branch length? But note: the branch length in Newick is typically the distance from the node to its parent. However, in our agglomerative clustering, the distance (or similarity) is from the node to the leaves? \n\n Actually, in UPGMA (which is a method that assumes a constant rate of evolution) the branch length from an internal node to a leaf is half the distance (if the leaf was merged at that node). But we are using single linkage and we are not building a rooted tree with branch lengths? \n\n Clarification: the problem says "build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram". A dendrogram is a tree diagram. The Newick format can represent the tree with branch lengths. However, the problem does not specify how to compute the branch lengths. \n\n But note: the problem says that we are using the raw similarity scores. And later we will cut the tree by similarity thresholds. Therefore, the critical information is the similarity at which each merge occurs. \n\n How do we assign branch lengths? \n   - We are not given any information about the branch lengths. We are only given pairwise similarities. \n   - In single linkage hierarchical clustering, we don\'t typically assign branch lengths to the internal nodes. We only have the height (the similarity) at which the merge occurs. \n\n Since the problem states that we must be able to cut the tree by thresholds (which are similarity scores) and the Newick format will be needed, we can do the following:\n\n   - We build the tree topology (the order of merges) and record the similarity for each merge (the value that triggered the merge).\n   - For the Newick format, we can output the tree with the branch lengths set to the difference in similarity between the node and its parent? But we don\'t have a natural way to do that.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent the tree without branch lengths? But the problem says "draw a dendrogram", and the Newick format usually includes branch lengths.\n\n After re-thinking: in a dendrogram from hierarchical clustering, the horizontal bar for a node is drawn at the height corresponding to the similarity (or distance) of that merge. The vertical lines are just connectors. In Newick, we can set the branch length from a node to its parent as the difference between the similarity of the parent and the child? But note: the root has the smallest similarity? and the leaves are at similarity 0? or the leaves are at the maximum similarity? \n\n Actually, the leaves are at the bottom (similarity = maximum value? no). The merge events happen at decreasing similarity as we go up. \n\n How about: \n   - We set the branch length for a leaf to be the similarity at which it was merged? But wait, a leaf is merged only once. \n\n Let me explain with an example:\n\n   Suppose we have three species: A, B, C.\n   Step1: merge A and B at similarity s1.\n   Step2: merge (A,B) with C at similarity s2 (s2 <= s1).\n\n   In the tree, the internal node for (A,B) is at height s1 (from the bottom). The internal node for the root (A,B,C) is at height s2.\n\n   The branch length from the root to the node (A,B) would be the difference: s1 - s2? \n   The branch length from (A,B) to A and to B would be s1? \n\n But wait, the entire tree is built from the leaves to the root. The leaf A is at the bottom (height 0). Then the node (A,B) is at height s1. Then the root is at height s2 (which is lower than s1?).\n\n That doesn\'t make sense because we want the root to be the highest (farthest from leaves). \n\n Actually, we are using similarity: higher similarity means closer. So the root (the entire tree) has the least similarity (because it includes all). Therefore, we can convert similarity to distance by: distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or (some base similarity - similarity). But the problem says we must use raw similarity.\n\n Alternatively, we can represent the branch lengths as the similarity of the merge event? But that would be large for the first merges and small for the last.\n\n And then the total branch length from a leaf to the root would be the sum of the branch lengths? \n\n However, the problem does not specify. Since the later steps require thresholding by similarity, we can store the similarity at the merge event in the internal node. For the Newick format, we can output the node label as the similarity? or use branch lengths as the similarity? \n\n The problem says: "draw a dendrogram". The height of the node in the dendrogram should be the similarity at which the merge occurs. Therefore, in the Newick format, we can set the branch length from a node to its parent to be the difference between the parent\'s similarity and the child\'s similarity? \n\n But note: the root doesn\'t have a parent. And the leaves have no merge event. \n\n Actually, we can set the branch length for a leaf to the difference between the maximum possible similarity (which we don\'t know) and the similarity at which the leaf was merged? This is getting messy.\n\n After standard practice: \n   In hierarchical clustering, the Newick format typically represents the distance at which the merge occurs. The branch length from a leaf to the first internal node is half the distance of the first merge? (if we use UPGMA). But we are using single linkage and we don\'t have branch lengths per se.\n\n Given the ambiguity, we will design the tree building without branch lengths for now. We will record:\n   - The tree structure (parent-child relationships)\n   - The similarity score at each internal node (the merge similarity)\n\n Then, when we output to Newick, we can represent the internal node by the similarity and the branch length from a node to its parent as the difference in similarity? Or we can output the tree without branch lengths? \n\n But the problem says: "save it in text Newick format". The Newick format requires branch lengths? Actually, it doesn\'t require them, but they are common.\n\n We have two options:\n   Option 1: Use the merge similarity as the branch length from the node to the root? That doesn\'t work because the root is the same for all.\n   Option 2: The branch length from a node to its children is the difference between the node\'s similarity and the child\'s similarity? \n\n For a leaf, we don\'t have a similarity for the leaf. We can set the leaf\'s similarity to a fixed value? \n\n Alternatively, we can define the branch length from an internal node to a child as:\n   - If the child is a leaf: then branch length = (similarity of the internal node) - (some base value? we don\'t have a base for the leaf). \n   - If the child is an internal node: branch length = (similarity of the current internal node) - (similarity of the child internal node).\n\n But note: the leaf doesn\'t have a similarity. We can set the leaf\'s similarity to the maximum similarity that that species has with any other? That is not available.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that the problem does not specify, we will focus on the tree structure and record the merge similarity. For the Newick format, we can output the internal nodes with the merge similarity as a label and without branch lengths? Or set all branch lengths to 1? \n\n However, the problem says that the dendrogram should represent the tree. The key is the height of the internal nodes (the merge similarity). Therefore, when drawing, the height of the node is the merge similarity. \n\n In Newick, we can represent the tree as:\n\n   (A:1, B:1)node1_sim=10:0\n\n This is not standard.\n\n After research, a common way to represent hierarchical clustering in Newick is to use the distance (or height) at which the merge occurs as the distance from the leaves. For example:\n\n   The tree with three species: \n        A and B merge at distance d1 (which would be: max_similarity - s1? if we convert similarity to distance), then (A,B) merges with C at distance d2.\n\n   Then the Newick would be: ((A:d1, B:d1):d2_difference, C:d2);\n\n But we don\'t have distances, we have similarities.\n\n We can define the distance as: d = max_similarity - s, where max_similarity is the maximum value in the similarity matrix? Then the first merge would have the smallest distance.\n\n However, the problem says we must use the raw similarity scores for thresholding. So we cannot convert to distance arbitrarily.\n\n Considering the requirement for thresholding: we will cut the tree at a similarity threshold T. That means we want to break the tree at edges where the similarity of the merge (stored in the internal node) is below T? or above? \n\n Actually, we want to break the tree at the point where the merge happened at similarity T. We want the clusters to be the subtrees that were merged at a similarity >= T. \n\n Therefore, we must store the similarity at the internal node. \n\n For the Newick format, we can output the tree with the internal nodes labeled by the similarity? and without branch lengths? \n\n Example: \n   Newick: (A,B)\'s merge node has similarity s1, and then merging with C at s2: \n        ((A,B)node1_s1, C)node2_s2;\n\n But the Newick standard allows for node labels and branch lengths. We can set branch lengths arbitrarily to 1 and use the node labels to store the similarity? \n\n Alternatively, we can store the similarity as the branch length of the edge above the node? \n\n Given the time, I propose:\n\n   We design the tree to have:\n        - Leaf nodes: only the species name.\n        - Internal nodes: \n             - leftChild, rightChild\n             - similarity: the similarity score at which the merge happened.\n\n   Then, when writing to Newick, we can output the tree in the following way:\n\n        Leaf: species name\n        Internal node: (left_child_string, right_child_string):similarity\n\n   But note: the branch length in Newick is the length from the node to the parent. We don\'t have that. So we can set the branch length for the edge from the node to the parent to 0? and then use the node label for the similarity? \n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        ((A:0,B:0):s1, C:0):s2;\n\n   Then the total branch length from A to the root would be s1+s2? and that doesn\'t represent the similarity.\n\n After careful thought, a better way is to use the similarity as the height from the root? \n\n   Let M = maximum similarity in the entire matrix. Then the distance from a leaf to the root is M - (similarity at which the leaf was first merged) + ...? \n\n This is complex.\n\n Given the project constraints and the fact that the problem states that the dendrogram drawing and Newick output will be a later task, we will focus now on building the tree structure (topology) and storing the merge similarity in the internal nodes. The branch length assignment can be done later when we have more requirements.\n\n So for now, we will:\n\n   - Build the tree using hierarchical clustering (single linkage) with the similarity matrix.\n   - Each internal node will store:\n        - The two children (left and right, which are Node objects)\n        - The similarity score at which the merge occurred.\n\n   - The leaves are just the species names.\n\n   - We will not assign branch lengths until the drawing step.\n\n   - The tree will be rooted: the last merge is the root.\n\n Steps for the algorithm:\n\n   We\'ll use the following:\n\n     - We have a list of current clusters. Initially, each cluster is a leaf'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3140, 'total_tokens': 7236, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2688}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2688, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 452}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '97419725-b57f-4f17-8496-2ad10472beae', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--86a1d924-3b76-4665-9257-cb40145ba48f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3140, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 7236, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2688}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to implement the hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) with single linkage, but note: we are using similarity (higher = more similar) instead of distance (lower = closer).\n However, most clustering algorithms work with distances. So we have two options:\n   Option 1: Convert similarity to distance. Since higher similarity means closer, we can use: distance = max_similarity - similarity.\n   But note: the problem states that we must use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores for the height of the internal nodes. So we cannot convert to distance arbitrarily.\n\n Important: The requirement is that the internal node for a merge of two clusters (or species) should have a height equal to the similarity score at which they were merged.\n\n How the algorithm works in our case:\n   We start with each species as a leaf node (with no children, and height 0? But note: the leaf nodes don\'t have a height in terms of the merge, but the internal nodes do).\n   We have a similarity matrix (from Needleman-Wunsch) for every pair of species.\n\n   Steps:\n   1. Initially, each species is in its own cluster. The height of each leaf is 0? Actually, in the dendrogram, the leaves are at the bottom (height 0). The internal nodes are placed at the height equal to the similarity score at which the two clusters are merged.\n\n   2. We need to find the two clusters (initially single species) that have the highest similarity (so we are doing single linkage: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two elements in the clusters? Actually, the problem says "single linkage", which for similarity would be the maximum similarity between any pair of elements from the two clusters?).\n\n   3. When we merge two clusters, we create a new internal node. The children of this node are the two clusters (which could be leaves or internal nodes). The node\'s height is the similarity score at which they are merged (i.e., the similarity that triggered the merge).\n\n   4. We update the similarity matrix: the new cluster is represented and we compute the similarity between the new cluster and every other cluster. For single linkage: the similarity between the new cluster and another cluster is the maximum similarity between any element of the new cluster and any element of the other cluster.\n\n   5. We repeat until there is only one cluster.\n\n   However, note: the problem states that we are to build a rooted tree with a root that is the common ancestor.\n\n   Important: The similarity scores we have are for pairs of species. But when we form a cluster, we have to compute the similarity between clusters. Since we are using single linkage and similarity, the similarity between cluster A and cluster B is:\n        sim(A, B) = max{ sim(a, b) for a in A, b in B }\n\n   But note: we are storing the similarity for every pair of species? How about for clusters? We can recompute by looking at the original pairwise similarities? However, that might be inefficient. Alternatively, we can update the similarity matrix as we merge.\n\n   However, the problem says: "the tree should be created with a single-linkage clustering method, using Needleman-Wunsch scores as similarity metric".\n\n   We\'ll represent the tree nodes as:\n        class Node {\n            String name; // for leaves, the species name; for internal nodes, we can generate a name or leave as null? We don\'t need for now, but for Newick we do.\n            double height; // the similarity score at which this node was created (for leaves, we set height=0? but note: in the dendrogram, leaves are at the bottom. However, the problem says: internal nodes have the height = the similarity score. Leaves don\'t have a similarity score from a merge. So we set leaves to have height 0.\n            Node left;\n            Node right;\n        }\n\n   But note: the example: Horse and Dog merged at 1200 -> the internal node has height 1200.\n\n   Steps for the algorithm:\n\n   Let n = number of species.\n\n   We maintain:\n     - A list of current clusters (each cluster is a set of species, and also we have a representative node for the cluster? Actually, we are building a tree so we need to keep the Node for the cluster).\n\n   However, for efficiency we can use a priority queue? But we have to update the similarities.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the standard hierarchical clustering algorithm:\n\n     Initialize:\n        clusters = [ each species as a cluster (with one node) ]\n        distances: a matrix of size n x n, but we are using similarities. We have a full matrix of pairwise similarities for the species.\n\n     We\'ll create a new matrix for cluster similarities? But note: the number of clusters decreases by one at each step.\n\n     We\'ll use:\n        clusters: a list of clusters (each cluster is a set of species? or a Node? Actually, we need to build a tree, so we\'ll keep a Node for each cluster that we can later use to build the tree).\n\n     Steps:\n\n        while number of clusters > 1:\n            Find the two clusters i and j (i < j) with the maximum similarity value.\n\n            Create a new cluster k by merging i and j.\n            The new node for cluster k: \n                node_k = new Node();\n                node_k.left = node_i; // the node representing cluster i\n                node_k.right = node_j; // the node representing cluster j\n                node_k.height = similarity(i, j)   // the similarity that caused the merge.\n\n            Remove clusters i and j and add cluster k.\n\n            Update the similarity matrix: for every other cluster l, \n                sim(k, l) = max( sim(i, l), sim(j, l) )   [because single linkage: the similarity between k and l is the maximum similarity between any element in k and any element in l. Since we are using the original pairwise similarities? But note: we don\'t have the original for every pair? Actually, we have the original for species, but for clusters we compute as above]\n\n        The last cluster is the root.\n\n   However, note: the similarity between two clusters that are not single species? We are storing the similarity for every pair of clusters? We can use a 2D array, but the size is decreasing? Or we can use a map: (cluster_i, cluster_j) -> similarity. But we have to update.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a priority queue of pairs (i, j) with the similarity, but then when we merge, we have to remove all pairs that involve i or j and add new pairs for the new cluster with every existing cluster.\n\n   Considering performance: if we have n species, then we have O(n^2) pairs initially, and each merge we remove O(n) pairs and add O(n) pairs. Total O(n^3) which is acceptable for a few hundred species? But if we have thousands, we need a better way.\n\n   However, the problem doesn\'t specify the number of species. We\'ll assume a moderate number (say, up to a few hundred). If we need to scale, we can use a better data structure later.\n\n   We\'ll do:\n\n        clusters: a list of clusters (each cluster has: a Node, and a set of leaf species names? because we need to compute the similarity between clusters: we need to know which species are in the cluster to compute the max similarity? Actually, we can store the set of species in the cluster for the purpose of similarity computation? But note: the similarity between two clusters is defined as the maximum similarity between any two species in the two clusters. And we have the original similarity matrix for every pair of species.\n\n        But we don\'t need the original matrix for every pair of species? Actually, we do: because we have to compute the similarity between two clusters by looking at every pair of species (one from each cluster). However, that would be O(|A|*|B|) for two clusters. And if we do this for every pair of clusters at every step, the total complexity becomes O(n^3). This is acceptable for n up to a few hundred.\n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the entire species-species similarity matrix and then for clusters, we can do:\n\n            sim(A, B) = max{ sim(a, b) for a in A, b in B }\n\n        We can store the entire matrix in a 2D array for the species. Then for clusters, we can compute the similarity by iterating over the species in A and B? But we have to store the set of species in the cluster.\n\n        How about: each cluster maintains the set of species it contains? Then when merging two clusters, the new cluster\'s species set is the union.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precompute the species-species similarity matrix (we already have this from task1: stored in a map: key is species1_species2, value is score).\n\n            clusters: a list of Cluster objects, where Cluster = { Node node, Set<String> species }\n\n            similarityMatrix: a 2D array? Or we can compute on the fly? Actually, we can avoid a 2D array for clusters by using a map: (cluster_i, cluster_j) -> similarity. But we don\'t need to store? We can compute when needed? But we are going to do a lot of max operations.\n\n        Alternatively, we can maintain a "similarity" between clusters in a priority queue. We\'ll have a max-heap (priority queue) that contains all pairs (i, j) with i<j and the similarity between cluster i and cluster j. Then at each step, we pop the pair with the highest similarity. But then we have to update the queue: remove all pairs that involve cluster i or cluster j, and then compute the similarity between the new cluster and every other cluster, and add those pairs.\n\n        How to compute the similarity between the new cluster and an existing cluster? \n            new_cluster = cluster_i ‚à™ cluster_j.\n            For an existing cluster_l (not i or j):\n                sim(new_cluster, cluster_l) = max( sim(cluster_i, cluster_l), sim(cluster_j, cluster_l) )? \n            But note: the similarity between cluster_i and cluster_l is defined as the max similarity between any species in i and any species in l. Similarly for j and l. However, the similarity between the new cluster and l is the max of the two? Actually, it is the max of the entire set? So:\n                sim(new, l) = max( max_{x in i, y in l} sim(x,y), max_{x in j, y in l} sim(x,y) ) = max( sim(i,l), sim(j,l) )\n\n        So if we store the similarity between clusters, then we can update without iterating over the species. But we have to store the entire cluster-cluster similarity? Actually, we don\'t have to store the entire matrix, but we do have to store the similarities we put in the priority queue.\n\n        We\'ll maintain:\n            clusters: list of clusters (each with a node, set of species, and an index? or an id for the cluster? We can use the index in the list? But note: we remove and add, so we need a way to identify which cluster is which.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a min-heap? Actually, we want the maximum similarity. So we can use a max-heap. In Java, we can use a PriorityQueue with a comparator that orders by similarity descending.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Let\'s assign an id for each cluster? Or we can use the cluster object and override equals? But we are going to remove pairs that involve a cluster that is merged.\n\n            We\'ll maintain:\n                clusters: a list of clusters (we remove the two that are merged and add the new one)\n                clusterSimilarities: a map that gives the similarity for any pair of clusters? Actually, we can avoid that by storing in the priority queue the pair and the similarity.\n\n            We can have a priority queue of `ClusterPair` objects: (cluster1, cluster2, similarity). We want to get the pair with the highest similarity.\n\n            However, when we merge two clusters, we have to remove all pairs that involve either of these clusters and then add new pairs for the new cluster with every existing cluster.\n\n            The number of pairs is O(n^2) and each merge we remove O(n) pairs and add O(n) pairs. Then the total operations are O(n^2 log n) if we use a heap? Actually, removing arbitrary elements from a PriorityQueue is O(n). So we might need to use a different data structure? Or we can mark the pairs as obsolete and skip them when popping.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a matrix for clusters? But the number of clusters is decreasing, and we are updating.\n\n        Given the complexity and that n is moderate, we can do:\n\n            Use a list of clusters: `clusters`.\n            Use a priority queue (max-heap) for pairs: `Queue<ClusterPair> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(ClusterPair::getSimilarity).reversed())`? Actually, we want max first.\n\n            But we can do: `new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b.similarity, a.similarity))` or `Comparator.comparingInt(ClusterPair::getSimilarity).reversed()`.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Initialize the queue with every pair (i, j) for i<j, with the similarity computed from the species-species matrix: which is the max over the species in cluster i and j? Actually, initially each cluster has one species. So the similarity for a pair (i,j) is the precomputed similarity between the two species.\n\n                Then:\n\n                    while clusters.size() > 1:\n                        poll a pair (i, j) from the queue. But it might be that one of the clusters has been merged? So we need to check if both clusters are still active.\n\n                    We\'ll maintain an array or set of active clusters? Or we can mark the clusters that have been merged? We can have a boolean flag? But then we have to check.\n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    while clusters.size() > 1:\n                        Remove the top of the queue until we get a pair where both clusters are still active.\n\n                    Then merge them.\n\n                    Then remove these two clusters from the list and add the new cluster.\n\n                    Then for every other active cluster k (that is still in the list), compute the similarity between the new cluster and k: \n                         sim(new, k) = max( sim(i, k), sim(j, k) )   [because we are storing the cluster-cluster similarity? But note: we don\'t have sim(i,k) stored? Actually, we can compute it by the definition? But we are storing the entire species-species matrix. However, we can avoid by storing the cluster-cluster similarity in a 2D array?]\n\n                Actually, we can precompute the entire species-species similarity matrix and then for two clusters A and B, we can compute:\n                    sim(A, B) = max{ speciesSimilarity[a][b] for a in A, b in B }\n\n                But that would be O(|A|*|B|) per pair. And if we do that for every new pair, the total complexity is O(n^3). We can do that if n is small.\n\n                Alternatively, we can store for each cluster the set of species, and then when we merge, the new cluster\'s species set is the union. Then for computing the similarity between the new cluster and another cluster, we iterate over the species sets? \n\n                We\'ll do:\n\n                    PrecomputedSpeciesSimilarity: a Map<String, Map<String, Integer>>? Or a 2D array? But we have the species names. We can use a Map<String, Integer> for the entire similarity matrix? We had from task1: a map with key "species1_species2" -> score. But note: we also have the symmetric pairs? And we have both orders? Actually, we stored the score for (species1, species2) and (species2, species1) are the same? And we stored one of them? In task1, we stored for every unordered pair? Actually, we stored for every pair in the output file: we used a key that is "species1_species2", but note: we stored both orders? Actually, no: we stored one key per unordered pair? Actually, we stored the key as the concatenation of the two names with an underscore, and we did for every unordered pair? So we have a map that contains the similarity for (s1, s2) and (s2, s1) are the same and stored under one key.\n\n                We can create a helper method:\n\n                    int computeClusterSimilarity(Cluster c1, Cluster c2, Map<String, Integer> speciesSimilarityMap) {\n                        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n                        for (String s1 : c1.species) {\n                            for (String s2 : c2.species) {\n                                // get the similarity for (s1, s2) from the map: key is s1+"_"+s2? or we stored both? Actually, we stored the key as the two species names in the order we used? We have to be consistent.\n\n                                // How did we store? In task1: we stored the key as the two names in alphabetical order? Actually, no: we stored as "species1_species2", and we did for every pair without ordering? But note: the input organisms were read and we did for every unordered pair? In the first task, we stored the key as the two species names in the order we iterated? Actually, we stored the key as the concatenation of the first species and the second species with an underscore? And we did both orders? Actually, no: we did for every unordered pair? We stored one key per unordered pair? How?\n\n                In the first task, we stored the key as: \n                    for (int i = 0; i < speciesList.size(); i++) {\n                        for (int j = i+1; j < speciesList.size(); j++) {\n                            String key = speciesList.get(i) + "_" + speciesList.get(j);\n                So the key is always the first species (in the order of the keys) and then the second? But the keys of the map in the input were not sorted? So the order is arbitrary? Actually, we did:\n\n                    speciesList = new ArrayList<>(speciesMap.keySet());\n                    Collections.sort(speciesList);   // we sorted? Actually, in the first task, we did not sort? We just took the keys and iterated. So the order was arbitrary? \n\n                But note: we stored the key as species1+"_"+species2, and we did for i<j? So we have each unordered pair exactly once. And the key is in the order of the list? But the list was created from the keySet, which is arbitrary? So we cannot rely on the order.\n\n                Therefore, to get the similarity between two species s1 and s2, we can try two keys: s1+"_"+s2 and s2+"_"+s1? Or we can store the scores in a 2D array and index by species? Alternatively, we can create a helper that for two species, forms the key in a canonical way: always sort'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3439, 'total_tokens': 7535, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 3136}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 3136, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 303}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'a4488843-2e08-4a63-8202-12a371771182', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--ad42c70e-ec9a-4887-96ce-ed21486bcd97-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3439, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 7535, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 3136}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to break down the project into several steps as per the conversation history. Since the last task was about saving the tree in Newick format, we\'ll now focus on that.\n\n However, note that the previous steps are:\n 1. Calculate Needleman-Wunsch scores for all pairs of species and save to a JSON file.\n 2. Build a phylogenetic tree (using hierarchical clustering with single linkage, but note: we are merging the most similar first, i.e., highest score) and assign heights to internal nodes as the similarity score at which they were merged.\n 3. Save the tree in two Newick formats.\n\n We have not generated code for step 2 (building the tree) yet, but the instruction for the current task is to generate code for saving the tree in Newick format. However, we must first build the tree.\n\n Since the current goal is to generate code for saving the tree, and we have not built the tree, we need to:\n - First, design a tree structure (from step 2) that can be traversed to produce the Newick format.\n - Then, implement the Newick formatting.\n\n Let\'s recall the requirements for step 2 (building the tree):\n   - Start with each organism as a leaf node.\n   - Merge the two most similar (highest Needleman-Wunsch score) at each step.\n   - Create an internal node for each merge. The internal node\'s height is the similarity score of that merge (the score of the two merged nodes).\n   - Continue until there is one root node.\n\n Important: We are using the Needleman-Wunsch score as a similarity (higher is better). However, note that in the clustering algorithm, we are going to use a method that merges the highest similarity. This is similar to single-linkage clustering but using similarity instead of distance.\n\n How to handle the clustering?\n   We can use an agglomerative (bottom-up) clustering approach. We\'ll maintain a distance matrix? But note: we have a similarity matrix. We can convert similarity to distance? The problem says: we must operate on similarity because later steps will use the raw scores.\n\n However, the clustering algorithm typically uses a distance (dissimilarity) measure. So we can convert the similarity to distance by:\n   distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or (some transformation) but note the requirement: the internal node must have the similarity score as its height.\n\n We are told that the internal node\'s height is the similarity score (e.g., 1200 for Horse and Dog). This height is the value of the similarity at which the two clusters are merged.\n\n Approach for hierarchical clustering with similarity (without converting to distance):\n   We can invert the sense: we are looking for the maximum similarity at each step to merge.\n\n Steps for building the tree (agglomerative clustering with maximum similarity):\n   - We start with each species as a cluster of one.\n   - We have a similarity matrix (from the Needleman-Wunsch scores) for every pair of clusters. Initially, the similarity between two clusters is just the NW score for the two species.\n   - At each step, we find the two clusters (i, j) with the highest similarity.\n   - We create a new cluster k by merging i and j.\n   - The similarity between the new cluster k and any other cluster l is computed as the maximum similarity between any node in k and any node in l (single linkage). However, note: we are using similarity and we want the highest similarity (which corresponds to the closest in terms of single linkage).\n\n   But note: the requirement says "single linkage methodology", but operating on similarity. Single linkage in distance is the minimum distance between any two points in the clusters. In similarity, the equivalent would be the maximum similarity between any two points.\n\n   So for two clusters A and B, the similarity between A and B is:\n        sim(A, B) = max{ sim(a, b) for a in A, b in B }\n\n   This is the same as the single linkage in terms of similarity.\n\n   However, the problem says: "we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score)".\n\n   Also, the internal node (the new cluster) is assigned a height equal to the similarity score that caused the merge (i.e., the highest similarity that we found at that step).\n\n   How to represent the tree?\n        We can have a Node class that can be either a leaf or an internal node.\n\n        For a leaf node:\n            name: the species name\n            height: 0? (since it\'s at the bottom) but note: the height of the internal node is the similarity score. Leaves don\'t have a similarity score by themselves? Actually, the height of a leaf is not used in the Newick format with distances? Or we set it to 0.\n\n        For an internal node:\n            left: left child\n            right: right child\n            height: the similarity score at which the merge happened (the score that was the highest at that step)\n\n   How to compute the branch lengths in the Newick format with distances?\n        The Newick format with distances usually represents the branch length from the node to its parent. However, in our tree, the height of a node is the similarity score at which the merge happened. The root has the smallest similarity? Actually, as we go up, the similarity decreases? Not necessarily: the similarity between clusters might be lower as we merge because we are taking the maximum similarity between any two leaves in the clusters, and as clusters become larger, the maximum similarity might be lower.\n\n        But note: the merging process: we start with the highest similarity and then progressively merge with lower similarities. So the root node will have the lowest similarity (the merge that happened last, when the two big clusters are merged).\n\n        In the Newick format with branch lengths, we usually represent the distance from the node to its children. However, the problem says: the internal node has a height (which is the similarity score). How do we convert that to branch lengths?\n\n        We can define:\n            For a leaf node, the branch length from the leaf to its parent is: (parent.height - 0) ? But note: the leaf doesn\'t have a height? We set the leaf height to 0? Actually, the similarity score for a leaf is not defined.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the tree as having the leaves at height 0 and the internal nodes at their merge height. Then the branch length from an internal node to its child is the difference in heights between the node and the child.\n\n        Example:\n          Let A and B be leaves. They are merged at height h1. Then the branch from the parent to A is h1 (if we set the leaves at height 0) or h1 - 0 = h1? But that would be the same for both.\n\n        Actually, in the example: \n          The internal node has height h1 (the similarity score). The leaves have no height? We can assign them height 0? Then the branch from the internal node to leaf A is h1 - 0 = h1? But that would be the same as the branch to leaf B? Then the total distance between A and B would be 2*h1? But the similarity score is h1, which is not a distance.\n\n        This is a problem because we are using similarity and not distance. We must be cautious.\n\n        However, the requirement for the Newick format with distances says: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers". And the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);"\n\n        How do we assign the numbers?\n\n        The problem states that the internal node has a height of the similarity score. In the dendrogram, the vertical axis is the similarity. The branch length in the horizontal direction is arbitrary? Actually, in a dendrogram, the horizontal lines are not to scale? But the vertical lines represent the similarity at which the merge occurs.\n\n        In the Newick format with branch lengths, the numbers are usually the lengths of the branches (the vertical lines in the dendrogram are the ones that matter for the distance between nodes?).\n\n        Actually, the Newick format with branch lengths is often used to represent the time or the amount of evolution. We are storing the similarity at the node as the height. Then the branch length from a node to its parent is the difference in height between the parent and the child.\n\n        For a leaf node, we set its height to 0? Then the branch from the leaf to its parent (the first internal node) is the height of the parent (because parent.height - 0 = parent.height).\n\n        For an internal node that is a child of another internal node: the branch length would be (parent.height - child.height).\n\n        Why? Because the child was formed at a higher similarity (so it is lower in the tree) and the parent at a lower similarity (higher in the tree). The difference in the similarity (heights) is the branch length.\n\n        Example: \n          We have two leaves A and B merged at height h1. Then they form a node N1 (height h1). Then later, N1 is merged with C at height h2 (which is lower than h1). Then the branch from N1 to the new root N2 would be (h2 - h1)? And the branch from C to N2 would be (h2 - 0) if C is a leaf? But wait, we should have merged C at a later time, so the branch from C to N2 would be (h2 - 0) = h2? That doesn\'t seem right because A and B are already merged at h1 and then merged with C at h2.\n\n        Actually, in a typical UPGMA tree (which assumes constant rate of evolution), the branch lengths are computed as the difference in heights. The height of the leaf is 0. The height of the internal node is the time of the merge. Then the branch from the leaf to the internal node is (internal node height - leaf height) = internal node height. For the next merge, the branch from the internal node to the new root is (new root height - old internal node height).\n\n        So we can do the same: the height of a leaf is 0. The height of an internal node is the similarity score at which it was formed. Then the branch length from a node to its parent is (parent.height - node.height). But note: the root has no parent? In the Newick tree, the root does not have a branch length? Actually, the root is the top and we don\'t assign a branch length to it? But in the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5)" the root has a branch length of 5? Actually, the root is the parent of (C,D) and also of A and B? Actually, the example tree is not clear.\n\n        Alternatively, we can represent the tree as:\n          The root is the last node (with the smallest similarity). Then the branch length for each child is the difference between the parent\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\n        So for the tree we build, we can traverse and assign branch lengths as the difference between the parent\'s height and the current node\'s height.\n\n        However, note: the problem says that the internal node has a height (the similarity score). We are not storing the branch lengths in the node, but we can compute them when writing the Newick format.\n\n        Steps for writing Newick format with branch lengths:\n          For a leaf node: \n             name + ":" + (parent.height - node.height)   [but the leaf node has height=0, so branch = parent.height - 0 = parent.height]\n\n          For an internal node:\n             We write: ( left_subtree, right_subtree ) : [if the node has a parent] (parent.height - node.height)\n\n          But note: the root node has no parent. So we don\'t assign a branch length to the root? Or we assign 0? The example: the root in the example has a branch length? Actually, in the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5)" the root has a branch length of 5? So the root is represented as a node that has a branch length of 5? That means the root is not the top? Actually, in Newick format, the root is the last semicolon and the entire tree is in parentheses. The branch length after the root\'s closing parenthesis is the branch length of the root? But the root has no parent? So we don\'t have that? Actually, the example has an extra branch at the root? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n          In the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" \n          This means: \n            There is a root that has three children: A, B, and a subtree (C,D). \n            The branch from the root to A is 1, to B is 2, and to the subtree (C,D) is 5.\n            The subtree (C,D) is a node (let\'s call it N) that has two children C and D with branch lengths 3 and 4? But wait, that would be: \n               (A:1, B:2, (C:3, D:4) :5)\n            Actually, the branch length 5 is for the entire subtree (C,D) from the root? Then the node N (the parent of C and D) has no branch length? \n\n        Actually, the correct interpretation is that the subtree (C,D) is at a distance 5 from the root. Then the node N (the root of the subtree) has two children: C at distance 3 and D at distance 4? But then the total distance from the root to C is 5+3=8? \n\n        This is ambiguous. Actually, the standard Newick format: \n          The entire subtree (C,D) is represented as (C:3, D:4) and then the branch from the root to the node of this subtree is 5. So the node of the subtree is at distance 5 from the root, and then C is at distance 3 from that node (so total 8) and D at distance 4 (so total 9). \n\n        But that is not typical. Typically, the branch lengths are from the node to its parent. So in a node, the children\'s branch lengths are the lengths from the child to the current node.\n\n        How we want to represent our tree?\n          We want the leaf to be at height 0, and the internal nodes at their merge height (similarity score). Then the branch length from a node to its parent is (parent.height - node.height).\n\n          For the root, we don\'t have a parent? So we don\'t assign a branch length to the root? But then how do we write the root in the Newick format? The root is the entire tree and we don\'t add a branch length to it? \n\n        Example of our tree:\n          Suppose we have two leaves A and B merged at height 10. Then the tree is:\n             Root (height 10) has two children: A and B.\n\n          How to write in Newick with branch lengths?\n             (A:10, B:10);\n          But note: the branch length from A to the root is (10 - 0) = 10, and similarly for B.\n\n          Now, if we then merge this with C at height 5 (which is lower, meaning less similar? but wait, we are merging the highest similarity first, so the first merge at 10, then the next at 5? That doesn\'t make sense because 5 is lower than 10. Actually, we should be merging in descending order of similarity. So the root of the entire tree will be the last merge at the lowest similarity.\n\n          But the problem says: "merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score)".\n\n          So the first merge (A and B) at similarity 10, then we have two clusters: AB and C. Then we merge AB and C at similarity 5 (which is the highest similarity between any leaf in AB and C). Then the root has height 5.\n\n          Then the tree is:\n             Root (height 5) has two children: AB (which is an internal node at height 10) and C (a leaf at height 0).\n\n          The branch from AB to the root is (5 - 10) = -5? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n        This reveals a problem: we cannot have the root at a lower height than its children. \n\n        How to resolve?\n          We must note: the similarity score is higher for more similar sequences. In a phylogenetic tree, the root (the common ancestor) is the oldest and the leaves are the present. The time from the root to the present is the same for all? But we are not representing time, we are representing similarity.\n\n        Actually, we are building a dendrogram where the vertical axis is the similarity at which clusters are merged. The leaves are at the bottom (similarity 0? or at the maximum similarity?).\n\n        We can invert the axis: instead of representing the height as the similarity, we can represent it as a dissimilarity by: \n          dissimilarity = max_similarity - similarity\n\n        But the problem says: the internal node should have the similarity score as its height. And later, we will use the raw scores for thresholding.\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the height as the similarity and then when computing branch lengths, we do:\n          branch_length = node.height - parent.height   [but then the branch length would be negative?]\n\n        Or we can store the tree with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom, and the height of the node is the similarity. Then the branch length from a node to its parent (which is above) would be (node.height - parent.height) which is negative? \n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Let me think: in the example of two leaves A and B merged at similarity 10. Then the root (the merge node) is at 10. The leaves are at 0. Then the branch from the leaf to the root is 10 (which is the difference: 10-0). Then we merge that cluster with C at similarity 5. The new root is at 5. Then the branch from the old root (10) to the new root (5) is 5-10 = -5? \n\n        We want positive branch lengths? Then we can define the branch length as (node.height - parent.height) but then it would be negative? \n\n        Alternatively, we can store the tree with the root at the bottom? But that is not conventional.\n\n        Another idea: \n          We can store the height of the node as the dissimilarity? But the problem says the internal node has the similarity score as its height.\n\n        How about we define the branch length as (parent.height - node.height) and then for the root, we don\'t assign a branch length? But note: the root has no parent.\n\n        However, in the merge of AB and C: \n          The root (let\'s call it R) has height 5. The child AB has height 10, and the child C has height 0 (leaf).

You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances.

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are now at the stage of drawing the dendrogram. We have already built the phylogenetic tree (using hierarchical clustering with the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores) and saved it in Newick format. Now, we need to visualize the tree as a horizontal dendrogram and save it as a PNG file.\n\nApproach:\n1. We have the tree structure from the previous step (the hierarchical clustering). The tree nodes have the height (which is the Needleman-Wunsch score at which the merge happened).\n2. We will use a library to draw the dendrogram. Since we are in Java, one option is to use JFreeChart, which has a `DendrogramPlot` class. However, note that JFreeChart\'s dendrogram is vertical by default. We need a horizontal one. Alternatively, we can use the Apache Batik library to generate SVG, but the requirement is PNG. Another option is to use the Java AWT/Swing to draw it ourselves, but that would be complex.\n\nGiven the complexity, I propose using JFreeChart and customizing it to be horizontal. However, note that the `DendrogramPlot` in JFreeChart is designed for vertical orientation. We can instead create a horizontal bar chart that mimics the dendrogram? Or we can rotate the entire chart? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the `CategoryPlot` and render the dendrogram as a horizontal tree. But this might be non-trivial.\n\nAnother idea: use the Newick string we generated and an external library that can visualize trees? But the requirement is to do it in Java.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will use JFreeChart and create a custom horizontal dendrogram by extending the `DendrogramPlot` and rotating the plot? Actually, let me check: JFreeChart\'s `DendrogramPlot` does not support horizontal orientation natively.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following approach:\n- Traverse the tree and calculate the positions and lines to draw.\n- Use Java AWT to draw the dendrogram on a `BufferedImage` and then save it as PNG.\n\nBut that would be a lot of code and complex.\n\nAfter reevaluation, I found that the JFreeChart does not have a horizontal dendrogram. Therefore, I will use a different approach: generate the dendrogram using the `TreeDraw` class from the `org.forester` library (if we can use it) which is part of the forester library for phylogenetics. However, we have not included that so far.\n\nGiven the project constraints (we can choose libraries freely), I propose to use the `forester` library for drawing the tree. The forester library can read Newick and generate images.\n\nSteps:\n1. We have the Newick string (with distances) in the file `tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`.\n2. We can read that Newick string and use forester to create a phylogenetic tree and then draw it.\n\nBut note: the requirement is to have the x-axis determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances (which are the heights in our tree). The forester library can do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `PhyloTree` and `Phylogeny` classes from `forester` to generate the image.\n\nHowever, we have to be cautious: the forester library might not be very well known and we are using Maven. We can add it as a dependency.\n\nBut note: the project requires production-ready code and we are in Java. We have to balance between using a library and the complexity of implementing a dendrogram drawer.\n\nGiven the time, I choose to use the forester library for this task.\n\nSteps in code:\n1. Add the forester dependency to the pom.xml.\n2. After building the tree (and saving the Newick), we read the Newick file with distances (or we can use the in-memory tree structure if we have it) and then use forester to create a `Phylogeny` object.\n3. Then we use the `TreePainter` to draw the tree horizontally and save as PNG.\n\nHowever, we already built the tree in our own structure. We can either:\n   a) Use the Newick file we saved to read it back with forester, or\n   b) Convert our own tree structure to a forester tree.\n\nOption (a) is simpler because we already have the Newick file.\n\nBut note: we are generating the Newick file without the internal node names? In our Newick format, we only have the leaf names and the branch lengths (distances). The internal nodes are anonymous. That is acceptable.\n\nLet\'s plan the code:\n\n1. After we have built the tree and saved the Newick with distances (to `tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`), we will read that file and parse it with forester.\n2. Then we will create a `Phylogeny` object from the Newick string.\n3. We will create a `TreePanel` and set the orientation to horizontal, and then set the phylogeny.\n4. Then we will save the `TreePanel` as a PNG.\n\nBut note: the requirement is that the x-axis is the Needleman-Wunsch score (which is the branch length). Forester by default uses branch lengths for the axis.\n\nHowever, we must note: in our tree, the branch lengths are the similarity scores? Actually, in the Newick format we saved, the branch lengths are the differences in height (the distance from the node to its parent). But the entire tree is built such that the height of a node is the similarity score at which the merge happened. So the branch length from a leaf to its parent is (root_height - leaf_height) but wait, that\'s not exactly how we built it.\n\nActually, in our hierarchical clustering (using similarity), the height of a node is the similarity at which the two children are merged. The branch length from the node to a child is (parent_height - child_height). But note: we did not store the branch lengths in the Newick as the differences? In our previous step, we stored the height of the node as the branch length? Let me clarify:\n\nIn our tree structure, each node (if it\'s an internal node) has a height (the similarity score). The branch length from a node to its parent is (parent.height - node.height). But the root node has no parent, and the leaves have height 0? Actually, no: the leaves are the original species, and we did not assign a height to them. We only assigned heights to internal nodes.\n\nIn the Newick format with distances, we stored the branch lengths. How did we compute the branch lengths? In the previous task, we stored the Newick with the branch lengths being the differences in the heights (the distance from a node to its parent). Specifically:\n\n- For a leaf, we set the branch length as (parent.height - 0) because the leaf has height 0? Actually, we did not assign a height to leaves. We only have heights for internal nodes.\n\nIn the previous step, when we saved the Newick with distances, we saved the branch lengths as the difference between the current node\'s height and the parent node\'s height? Actually, we did not have a parent node\'s height stored. We had the node\'s height (which is the similarity score at which the node was created). And the branch length from a node to its parent is (parent.height - node.height). But note: the root node has no parent, so we set its branch length to 0? Or we don\'t store it? \n\nWait, in the Newick string we generated for the node, we stored the branch length for each child. For example, if we have a node with two children (A and B) and the node\'s height is 1200, and the children are leaves (so their heights are 0), then the branch lengths for A and B would be 1200? But that would be the entire height from the leaf to the node? Actually, that is the distance from the leaf to the node.\n\nSo in the Newick format, we have: (A:1200, B:1200). Then if we have another node above this one at height 1500, then the branch from the first node to the root would be (1500 - 1200) = 300. So we would have: ((A:1200, B:1200):300).\n\nBut in our previous step, we did not store the branch lengths as the differences. We stored the absolute height? Actually, we stored the height of the node as the branch length for the children? Let me check the previous instruction:\n\nWe were told: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00)." and the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);"\n\nIn our case, the branch length for a leaf node (child of an internal node) would be the height of the internal node (because the leaf is at 0). Then the branch length for the internal node to its parent would be (parent.height - node.height).\n\nSo we did compute the branch lengths as the difference in heights? Yes, in the code for the previous task, we should have computed the branch lengths as the difference between the parent node\'s height and the current node\'s height.\n\nTherefore, the Newick file we saved has the branch lengths as the differences. This is the standard way.\n\nNow, the forester library can read this Newick and draw the tree. The x-axis will be the cumulative branch length from the root? Actually, in a phylogram, the x-axis represents the branch lengths. We want the x-axis to be the similarity (which is the height, but note: the branch length is the difference in height). So the total length from the root to a leaf is the root\'s height? Because:\n\nroot.height = 1500, and the leaf is at 0, so the total branch length is 1500? But we broke it into two segments: from the leaf to its parent (1200) and from the parent to the root (300). The total is 1500.\n\nTherefore, the x-axis (if we draw the tree with branch lengths) will have the root at 0 and the leaves at 1500? But we want the leaves to be at 0 and the root at 1500? That would be the opposite.\n\nActually, in a dendrogram, we usually have the leaves on one side (left or bottom) and the root on the other. And the branch lengths are drawn proportionally. We want the x-axis to represent the similarity (height). So the leaves are at x=0 and the root is at x=1500? But in our Newick, the branch lengths are from the node to the parent (towards the root). So the entire tree would be drawn with the root at the right (if horizontal) at x=1500 and the leaves at x=0? Actually, the leaves would be at x = (total branch length from the leaf to the root). But that is the same as the root\'s height.\n\nBut note: we want the x-axis to be the raw Needleman-Wunsch score (the height). So the position of a node should be its height. In the tree, the height of the root is the maximum similarity (the highest score) and the leaves are at 0.\n\nTherefore, we can set the tree drawing to use the branch lengths and the x-axis will naturally be the cumulative branch length from the leaf (which is the height of the node). But wait: the branch length from a leaf to a node is the node\'s height. Then from the node to the root is the root\'s height minus the node\'s height. So the total length from leaf to root is the root\'s height.\n\nIn the drawing, we want the internal node to be placed at x = node.height. Then the branch from the leaf to the node is drawn from x=0 to x=node.height, and then from the node to the root from x=node.height to x=root.height.\n\nSo the drawing should be with the leaves at x=0 and the root at x=root.height? But that is the opposite of the usual way. Usually, the root is at the left and the leaves at the right? But we want the root at the right (with the highest x value) and the leaves at the left (x=0). That is acceptable.\n\nThe forester library by default draws the tree with the root at the left and the leaves to the right? But we can set the orientation to horizontal and invert the axis? Actually, we can set the direction.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `TreeDraw` class and set the parameters. But I think it\'s easier to use the `Phylogeny` and `TreePanel` and then adjust.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are running out of time, I will generate the code to use forester to draw the tree. We will:\n\n1. Read the Newick file with distances (the one we saved: `tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`).\n2. Parse it into a `Phylogeny` object.\n3. Create a `TreePanel` and set the orientation to horizontal and the root at the right? Actually, we want the leaves on the left and the root on the right (so the tree grows from left to right).\n\nWe can set the direction in `TreePanel` by `setRootAtLeft(false)`? Actually, in the `TreePanel` there is a method `setRootAtLeft(boolean)` and by default it is true. So setting to false would put the root at the right.\n\nBut note: the branch lengths are the same regardless of direction.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Add the forester dependency to the pom.xml.\n2. Write a method that:\n   - Takes the Newick file path and an output PNG file path.\n   - Parses the Newick file.\n   - Creates a `TreePanel` and sets the orientation and root position.\n   - Saves the tree as PNG.\n\nBut note: the `TreePanel` is a Swing component. We can use it to generate an image without displaying.\n\nWe can use:\n\n```java\nPhylogeny phylogeny = PhylogenyParser.newParser().parse(new File(newickFilePath))[0];\nTreePanel treePanel = new TreePanel();\ntreePanel.setRootAtLeft(false); // put root at the right\ntreePanel.setMaintainAspectRatio(true);\ntreePanel.setDisplayedTree(phylogeny);\ntreePanel.setSize(1000, 600); // adjust as needed\n\n// Now save the treePanel to an image\nBufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(treePanel.getWidth(), treePanel.getHeight(), BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);\nGraphics2D g2 = image.createGraphics();\ntreePanel.paint(g2);\ng2.dispose();\nImageIO.write(image, "png", new File(pngFilePath));\n```\n\nBut note: the `TreePanel` might not be designed for offscreen rendering? We can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `Graphics2D` directly.\n\nBut let me check: the `TreePanel` extends `JPanel`, so we can call `paint` on it.\n\nHowever, we must set the size appropriately to fit the tree.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `TreeDraw` class from forester which is designed for command line drawing? But that might not be available.\n\nGiven the above, I will implement the above approach.\n\nBut note: we must set the tree in the panel and then set the size. The panel does not know its preferred size until we set the tree? We can call `doLayout()`? Actually, the `TreePanel` has a method `setPreferredSize` but we don\'t know the size in advance.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `TreePanel` to calculate the preferred size? But we can set the size arbitrarily and then the tree will scale? We can set the size to a fixed value (e.g., 1000x600) and then the tree will be drawn within that.\n\nBut the labels might get cut off? We can adjust.\n\nAlternatively, we can let the `TreePanel` calculate the preferred size by:\n\n```java\ntreePanel.setDisplayedTree(phylogeny);\ntreePanel.setRootAtLeft(false);\ntreePanel.setPreferredSize(null); // to let it calculate\ntreePanel.doLayout();\nDimension d = treePanel.getPreferredSize();\ntreePanel.setSize(d);\n```\n\nBut note: the preferred size might be huge if the tree is large. So we might set a maximum and use scrolling? But we are saving to an image, so we can set the image size to the preferred size.\n\nBut if the tree is too big, we might run out of memory. So we set a maximum and scale? Actually, we can set a fixed width and let the height adjust? Or we can set a fixed size and the tree will scale to fit.\n\nThe `TreePanel` has a method `setMaintainAspectRatio` but I\'m not sure.\n\nGiven the complexity, I will set a fixed size (1000x600) and hope it fits. Alternatively, we can calculate the required height: it is proportional to the number of leaves. The width we set to 1000, and the height we can set to (number_of_leaves * 30). But that is an estimate.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `Phylogeny` to calculate the required dimensions? The forester library has a `TreeLayout` that can compute the bounds.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I will set the width to 1000 and the height to (number_of_leaves * 30) with a minimum of 600.\n\nCode steps:\n\n1. Parse the Newick file to get the `Phylogeny` object.\n2. Count the number of leaves: `phylogeny.getNumberOfTerminals()`.\n3. Set the height of the image: `Math.max(600, numLeaves * 30)`.\n4. Create a `TreePanel` and set the tree and the root at the right.\n5. Set the size of the panel to (1000, height).\n6. Paint the panel to a `BufferedImage`.\n7. Save the image.\n\nBut note: the `TreePanel` might not be laid out until we call `doLayout()`. So we do:\n\n```java\ntreePanel.setSize(1000, height);\ntreePanel.doLayout();\n```\n\nThen paint.\n\nNow, let\'s generate the code.\n\nWe\'ll create a new class `DendrogramDrawer` that will handle this.\n\nWe\'ll also add the forester dependency to the pom.xml.\n\nBut note: we are using Maven, so we must update the pom.\n\nAdd:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.forester</groupId>\n    <artifactId>forester</artifactId>\n    <version>1.052</version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->\n</dependency>\n```\n\nHowever, I found that the latest version on Maven Central is 1.052 (from 2018). We\'ll use that.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFile: `src/main/java/com/example/phylogenetictree/DendrogramDrawer.java`\n\nThis class will have a method to draw the dendrogram from the Newick file and save to PNG.\n\nWe\'ll call this method from the main workflow.\n\nBut note: we are using the Newick file we generated in the previous step. So we must have'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3832, 'total_tokens': 7928, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 3648}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 3648, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 184}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '1d3eda1e-d0cd-4ea1-964e-219e47adc2c1', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--93398466-7ef7-4487-aa6f-843d4d01efaf-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3832, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 7928, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 3648}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are at the final task: clustering based on thresholds.\n Steps:\n 1. Read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" (each line is one integer threshold).\n 2. For each threshold, traverse the tree (built in the previous step) to form clusters of species (leaf nodes).\n    - The idea: at a given threshold, we ignore any branches above that threshold (i.e., we break the tree at that height). \n      Then, the connected components below that threshold form the clusters.\n    - Since our tree is built by agglomerative clustering and each internal node has a height (the similarity score at which the merge happened), \n      we can traverse from the root downward. However, note: we break the tree at the threshold. \n      Specifically, if the height of an internal node is below the threshold, then the two clusters it merged are still separate. \n      If the height is above the threshold, then that node and everything below it form one cluster? \n\n But note: \n   - Our tree is built with similarity scores: higher score means more similar and they are merged first (so the highest scores are at the bottom). \n   - However, in the tree, the root has the highest score? Actually, in our building process, we started with each species as a leaf and merged the two with the highest similarity. \n     Then we created a new node with that similarity as its height. Then we continued. The root node will have the lowest similarity (because we merge the last two clusters that are least similar). \n\n However, wait: the problem says that we start by merging the most similar (highest score). So the leaves are at the bottom (height=0?) and the root is at the top (with the smallest similarity?).\n\n But in our dendrogram, we are using the Needleman-Wunsch score as the height (x-axis). So the root will have the smallest score? Actually, no: the root is the last merge, so it has the lowest similarity? \n\n Clarification: \n   - When we merge two clusters, we assign the node a height equal to the similarity score of that merge. \n   - The leaves are individual species and we can assign them a height (similarity) of 0? Or we don\'t assign them a height? \n\n Actually, in our previous tree building, we did:\n   - Each leaf node: we didn\'t assign a height? Or we assigned 0? \n   - Then when merging two nodes (could be leaves or clusters) with similarity score s, we create a new node with height = s.\n\n Now, the threshold is a value in the same units as the similarity scores. \n\n How to form clusters for a threshold T?\n   - We traverse the tree (post-order or pre-order) and at each internal node:\n        if node.height >= T: then the entire subtree under this node is one cluster (because the merge happened at a similarity above the threshold, meaning the species are similar enough to be in the same cluster at this threshold).\n        if node.height < T: then we break the tree at this node? Meaning we don\'t consider the children to be in the same cluster? \n\n But note: \n   - The root node has the smallest height (because it\'s the last merge, least similar). \n   - The leaves have no height? Or we can consider them as having height 0? \n\n Actually, we have to design the clustering:\n\n   Approach:\n     We can do a depth-first traversal starting from the root. For a given threshold T, we want to collect clusters of leaf nodes (species) that are connected without any break (i.e., without encountering a node with height < T).\n\n     However, note: if an internal node has height >= T, then all the leaves under it form one cluster. We don\'t need to traverse below because the entire subtree is one cluster.\n\n     If an internal node has height < T, then we break the tree at that node and consider the left and right subtrees as separate clusters? But wait: the children of this node might be internal nodes with their own heights. \n\n     Actually, we traverse the tree and whenever we find a node with height < T, we break the tree at that node and then recursively form clusters from its children. \n\n     Algorithm for one threshold T:\n        clusters = [] \n        stack = [root]\n        while stack not empty:\n            pop node from stack\n            if node is leaf:\n                then add a new cluster [node.name]\n            else:\n                if node.height >= T:\n                    then we form one cluster of all leaves under this node -> we can collect all leaves in the subtree and add as one cluster.\n                else: \n                    then we break: push the two children onto the stack.\n\n        However, note: if we break at a node (because height < T) then we push its children. But if we don\'t break (height>=T) then we take the entire subtree as one cluster.\n\n     But how to get all leaves in the subtree? We can pre-store the list of leaves in each node? Or we can traverse the subtree? \n\n     Alternatively, we can do a recursive DFS:\n\n        function findClusters(node, T):\n            if node is leaf:\n                return [ [node.name] ]\n            else:\n                if node.height >= T:\n                    # Then we don\'t break: the entire subtree is one cluster\n                    # But we must collect all leaves under this node\n                    leaves = getAllLeaves(node)\n                    return [ leaves ]\n                else:\n                    left_clusters = findClusters(node.left, T)\n                    right_clusters = findClusters(node.right, T)\n                    return left_clusters + right_clusters\n\n        However, this might be inefficient because we traverse the subtree for leaves when we don\'t break? We can precompute the leaves for each node during tree building.\n\n     We can store in each node a list of leaf names (the species in that cluster). Then:\n\n        if node.height >= T:\n            return [ node.leafNames ]   # one cluster\n        else:\n            return findClusters(node.left, T) + findClusters(node.right, T)\n\n     But note: what if the node has more than two children? Our tree is binary? Yes, because we merged two at a time.\n\n     So we can store in each internal node the list of leaf names in the subtree.\n\n     Steps for building the tree (earlier task) should have included storing the list of leaf names in the node.\n\n     We did not generate that in the tree building code? Let me recall: in the previous tree building step, we created a tree for the dendrogram. We had:\n\n        class Node {\n            String name; // for leaf: species name; for internal: generated name? or null? \n            int height; // the similarity score at which this node was created (for leaf, we set to 0)\n            Node left;\n            Node right;\n            // We can add:\n            List<String> leafNames; // all leaf names in the subtree\n        }\n\n     For leaf: \n          name = species name, height = 0, left=null, right=null, leafNames = [species name]\n     For internal node:\n          name = null? or we can generate "NodeX", but we don\'t need it for clustering. \n          height = similarity score of the merge\n          left, right = the two children\n          leafNames = left.leafNames + right.leafNames\n\n     Then the algorithm for one threshold T is:\n\n        public List<List<String>> getClusters(Node root, int threshold) {\n            if (root == null) {\n                return new ArrayList<>();\n            }\n            // If it\'s a leaf, then we return a cluster with just this leaf.\n            if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {\n                List<String> cluster = new ArrayList<>();\n                cluster.add(root.name);\n                List<List<String>> clusters = new ArrayList<>();\n                clusters.add(cluster);\n                return clusters;\n            }\n\n            // If the current node\'s height is >= threshold, then the entire subtree is one cluster.\n            if (root.height >= threshold) {\n                List<List<String>> clusters = new ArrayList<>();\n                clusters.add(root.leafNames);\n                return clusters;\n            }\n\n            // Otherwise, we break and get clusters from left and right.\n            List<List<String>> leftClusters = getClusters(root.left, threshold);\n            List<List<String>> rightClusters = getClusters(root.right, threshold);\n            leftClusters.addAll(rightClusters);\n            return leftClusters;\n        }\n\n 3. We need to run this for every threshold in the "thresholds.txt" file.\n\n 4. Output: For each threshold, we want to write the clusters to a file. The output file should be named "clusters_threshold_<threshold>.json", \n    and it should contain a JSON array of arrays of species names. For example, if at threshold 1200 we have two clusters: [ ["Horse", "Donkey"], ["Cat", "Dog"] ], then the file should be:\n\n        [["Horse","Donkey"],["Cat","Dog"]]\n\n 5. Also, note: the thresholds are integers and the files should be named exactly as above (with the threshold value).\n\n 6. We assume the tree was built and stored in memory from the previous step.\n\n Implementation plan:\n\n   We have a main class that coordinates:\n        - Reading the thresholds from "thresholds.txt"\n        - For each threshold, call the clustering algorithm on the tree (which we built earlier and have in memory)\n        - Write the clusters to a JSON file.\n\n   We\'ll create a new class for the clustering by threshold.\n\n   Steps in code:\n\n        // Assume we have the tree root from the previous step (tree building)\n        List<Integer> thresholds = readThresholds("thresholds.txt");\n        for (int threshold : thresholds) {\n            List<List<String>> clusters = TreeClusterFinder.findClusters(root, threshold);\n            // Sort each cluster? (optional) and then write to JSON\n            writeClustersToJson(clusters, "clusters_threshold_" + threshold + ".json");\n        }\n\n   We need to write the clusters as a JSON array of arrays.\n\n 7. We\'ll use Jackson or Gson? We already used Jackson in previous steps.\n\n Let\'s note: we have been using Jackson for JSON. So we can use ObjectMapper to write the clusters.\n\n 8. We must be cautious: the threshold might be higher than the root\'s height? Then we get one cluster of all species? \n    Or if the threshold is lower than any internal node? Then we get each species as a cluster.\n\n 9. Also, note: the leaf nodes have height 0. So if threshold is 0, then every leaf node will form its own cluster? \n    But our algorithm for leaves returns a cluster of one. And if we break at an internal node (if its height < threshold) then we go to children. \n    But if the threshold is 0, then at every internal node: \n        if node.height < 0? -> we break. \n        But our similarity scores are positive? Actually, the Needleman-Wunsch scores can be negative? \n\n    However, in the example we had positive (7) and the BLOSUM scores had negative for mismatches and positive for matches. \n    But overall, the alignment score could be negative? \n\n    We must consider: the thresholds are taken from the range of the scores. The user will provide thresholds that are in the range of the scores we calculated.\n\n    Our algorithm should work regardless of the sign.\n\n 10. We\'ll assume the tree structure we built has the root node with the smallest score (because it was the last merge) and leaves at 0? Or leaves at 0? \n\n     Actually, we set leaves to 0. Then the internal nodes have positive scores? Or negative? \n\n     In our example: the scores are positive? But it depends on the BLOSUM matrix. \n\n     The algorithm is independent of the sign.\n\n 11. Implementation:\n\n     We need to modify the Node class to include the list of leaf names. We did not do that in the tree building step? \n\n     In the previous tree building code, we had:\n\n        class Node {\n            String name; // for leaves: the species name; for internal nodes: we generated a name like "NodeX" (but we don\'t use it for clustering by threshold)\n            double distance; // we used double? But we were asked to use integers? \n\n     Wait, in the previous task for the tree building, we stored the height as the similarity score (integer). And we built the tree with:\n\n        public Node(String name) {\n            this.name = name;\n            this.height = 0; // for leaf\n            this.left = null;\n            this.right = null;\n            this.leafNames = new ArrayList<>();\n            this.leafNames.add(name);\n        }\n\n        public Node(Node left, Node right, int height) {\n            this.name = "Node_" + (++nodeCount); // or we don\'t care about the internal node name? \n            this.height = height;\n            this.left = left;\n            this.right = right;\n            this.leafNames = new ArrayList<>();\n            this.leafNames.addAll(left.leafNames);\n            this.leafNames.addAll(right.leafNames);\n        }\n\n     But we did not generate that in the tree building? We must update the tree building code to include leafNames.\n\n     However, the task for tree building was already completed. We are now in the final task.\n\n     We have two options:\n        a) We go back and modify the tree building to include leafNames in the nodes.\n        b) We do a one-time traversal to compute the leafNames for each node? \n\n     Since we are generating the entire project step by step, we can assume we have the leafNames in the node? \n\n     But in the code we generated for tree building, we did not have that. \n\n     We generated the tree building code in the step "Generating a code for building a tree". We had a class `PhylogeneticTreeBuilder` and a class `Node`. \n\n     Let me recall: we had:\n\n        public class Node {\n            private final String name;   // For leaf nodes, this is the species name. For internal nodes, we generate a unique name.\n            private final int height;    // The similarity score at which this node was created (for leaf, 0)\n            private final Node left;\n            private final Node right;\n\n            // Constructor for leaf\n            public Node(String name) {\n                this(name, 0, null, null);\n            }\n\n            // Constructor for internal node\n            public Node(Node left, Node right, int height) {\n                this("NODE_" + UUID.randomUUID().toString().substring(0, 8), height, left, right);\n            }\n\n            private Node(String name, int height, Node left, Node right) {\n                this.name = name;\n                this.height = height;\n                this.left = left;\n                this.right = right;\n            }\n\n            // getters...\n        }\n\n     We did not store the leaf names. We need to add:\n\n        private List<String> leafNames;\n\n        And in the leaf constructor:\n            this.leafNames = Collections.singletonList(name);\n\n        In the internal node constructor:\n            this.leafNames = new ArrayList<>(left.getLeafNames());\n            this.leafNames.addAll(right.getLeafNames());\n\n        And a getter for leafNames.\n\n     But we already generated the tree and stored the tree? Then we cannot change the tree building without re-running? \n\n     However, the project is being built step by step. We are now at the final task. We can modify the tree building step? \n\n     But the instruction says: "Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement". \n\n     We are now generating the code for the third task. We are not modifying the tree building step? \n\n     We have two choices:\n\n        Option 1: We assume that the tree building step has been run and we have a tree in memory. We can compute the leaf names for each node in a post-order traversal? \n\n        Option 2: We update the Node class and the tree building code to store leafNames. Then we run the tree building again? \n\n     Since we are building the entire project, and the tree building is done in the same run, we can update the Node class and the tree building to store leafNames. \n\n     But note: the tree building step was already generated. We are now at the final task. \n\n     We are allowed to modify the entire project? \n\n     However, the instruction for this task does not say to modify the tree building. \n\n     We can do without modifying the tree building? We can traverse the tree and build the leafNames for each node? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            public static void computeLeafNames(Node node) {\n                if (node == null) return;\n                if (node.isLeaf()) {\n                    node.leafNames = new ArrayList<>();\n                    node.leafNames.add(node.getName());\n                } else {\n                    computeLeafNames(node.getLeft());\n                    computeLeafNames(node.getRight());\n                    node.leafNames = new ArrayList<>(node.getLeft().leafNames);\n                    node.leafNames.addAll(node.getRight().leafNames);\n                }\n            }\n\n        Then call this on the root after building the tree? \n\n     But we don\'t have a setter for leafNames in the Node class? We made the Node class immutable? \n\n     We had:\n\n        private final List<String> leafNames;   // we didn\'t have this field.\n\n     So we have to change the Node class to include leafNames. And we have to set it during construction? Or we can make it mutable? \n\n     Given that we are building the entire project and we are at the final step, I think we should update the tree building step to include leafNames. \n\n     But the instruction says: "Generating a code for building a tree" was already done. Now we are at the clustering step.\n\n     Alternatively, we can create a wrapper class for the tree that caches the leaf names? Or we can compute the leaf names on the fly in the clustering algorithm? \n\n     We\'ll do:\n\n        In the clustering algorithm, we can traverse the subtree to collect leaf names when we need to? But that would be inefficient for large trees. \n\n     We are going to run the clustering for multiple thresholds. So we don\'t want to traverse the subtree for every node that we break? \n\n     Therefore, we should precompute the leaf names for every node. \n\n     We\'ll update the Node class and the tree building step to include leafNames. We\'ll do that in this step? \n\n     But the instruction for this task is only for the clustering. \n\n     We are allowed to modify previous steps? The problem says: "Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement". \n\n     We are going to modify the tree building step (the Node class and the way we build the tree) to include leafNames. \n\n     How about we do:\n\n        Step 1: Update the Node class to have a list of leafNames (and make it final, set in the constructor).\n\n        Step 2: Update the tree building code to set the leafNames at construction time.\n\n        Step 3: Then in the clustering step, we can use node.getLeafNames().\n\n     We\'ll generate the updated Node class and the tree building code? But we are in the final task. \n\n     Alternatively, we can do a one'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4031, 'total_tokens': 8127, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 3776}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 3776, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 255}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '5a1bec7a-3773-464a-868c-099cc41bfc10', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--93de4c38-b7d8-4731-b3cf-83ecf35883d9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4031, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8127, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 3776}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

Read organisms.json and blosumXX.json\n 2. Implement Needleman-Wunsch algorithm using the provided substitution matrix and gap penalties (from the blosum file)\n 3. Calculate the similarity matrix for all pairs of species (stored in a structure for fast access, e.g., Map of Map or 2D array)\n 4. Save the similarity scores to a JSON file (organisms_scores_blosumXX.json) with keys as "species1_species2"\n 5. Build a phylogenetic tree (using hierarchical clustering with single linkage, but note: we are merging based on highest similarity, which is equivalent to using a distance = max_similarity - similarity, then using single linkage on that distance? However, the requirement is to use raw similarity and merge the most similar first. We can use the similarity directly and in each step merge the two clusters with the highest similarity. This is known as complete linkage? Actually, no: the problem says single linkage, but note: single linkage uses the maximum similarity (or minimum distance) between any two points in the clusters. Since we are using similarity, we want the maximum similarity between any two points in the clusters. So we can do:\n\n   We are going to do agglomerative clustering with the following:\n     - Each cluster initially is a single species.\n     - The similarity between two clusters is defined as the maximum similarity between any two species from each cluster (single linkage for similarity).\n     - At each step, we merge the two clusters with the highest similarity.\n\n 6. Represent the tree with nodes that record the height (the similarity score at which the merge happened) and the leaves.\n 7. Save the tree in two Newick formats: without distances and with distances (the distances in the Newick with distances are the branch lengths? But note: in our tree, the height of a node is the similarity score. However, the Newick format usually uses distances (time) from the node to the children. We have to convert the similarity score to a distance? But the problem says: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as integers", and it says to use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores. However, note that the example in the tree building step: the node for Horse and Dog has a height of 1200. In the Newick format with distances, we have to represent the branch lengths. How do we get branch lengths?\n\n   We can define:\n     - The height of a node is the similarity score at which the merge happened.\n     - The branch length from a node to its child is the difference between the node\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\n   For example:\n        Suppose we have three species: A, B, C.\n        First we merge A and B at similarity score 1200 (so the node AB has height 1200).\n        Then we merge AB and C at similarity score 1000 (so the root has height 1000).\n        Then the branch from root to AB is 1000 - 1200 = -200? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n   Actually, we are building a dendrogram where the y-axis (height) is the similarity. As we go up, similarity decreases. So the distance (in terms of dissimilarity) increases. We want the branch lengths to be positive? We can invert the scale: let the distance = (max_similarity - similarity) at the node? But the problem says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" for the dendrogram. And for the Newick format with distances, we are to use integers without decimals.\n\n   Clarification from the requirement: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number" and "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". Also, the example in the tree building step: the node for Horse and Dog has a height of 1200.\n\n   How about we store the node heights as the similarity (so high number means closer in time) and then when we write the Newick with distances, we write the branch lengths as the difference in heights? But note: the root is the highest node (earlier in time) and the leaves are the present (with the highest similarity?).\n\n   Actually, in a phylogenetic tree, the branch lengths represent the amount of evolution (distance). We have a similarity score that is higher for more similar sequences. We can define the distance as:\n\n        distance = (max_similarity - similarity)   [but note: the similarity between two identical sequences is the highest, and then decreases]\n\n   However, the requirement says: "the tree will show branching in evolutionary history" and "internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors". Also, the requirement for the dendrogram: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" meaning the similarity? But note: the dendrogram is usually drawn with the leaves at the same level and the branching points at different heights (y-axis) representing the distance (or similarity). The problem says: "horizontally", meaning the branches are horizontal and the labels are on the left? And the x-axis would represent the similarity? Then we don\'t need to invert.\n\n   But the Newick format with distances expects branch lengths (which are additive). We can define:\n\n        For a leaf node, the distance from the leaf to its parent is: (parent\'s height) - (leaf\'s height) -> but the leaf\'s height? We haven\'t defined a height for leaves.\n\n   We can assign:\n        Each leaf node has a height of infinity? Or we can set the leaf nodes to have a height that is the maximum similarity? Actually, we don\'t have a similarity for a single species.\n\n   Alternative approach: we build the tree by merging, and we record the height (similarity) of each node. Then the branch length from a parent to a child is: (parent\'s height) - (child\'s height). Since the parent is always lower (or equal) in similarity than the child? Because we are merging from the highest similarity (closest in time) to the lowest (further back in time). So the branch length would be positive? Actually, the parent\'s height (similarity) is the similarity at which the merge happened, and the child (if it is a leaf) we haven\'t defined a height. So we need to assign a height for leaves.\n\n   How about we set the height for a leaf to be the maximum possible similarity? But what is that? It could be the self-similarity? But note: we didn\'t calculate self-similarity. We could set the leaf height to be the maximum similarity that we have in the entire matrix? But that might be arbitrary.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define the branch length from a node to its child as the difference between the node\'s height and the child\'s height, but for a leaf we set its height to be the maximum similarity found in the entire matrix? Then:\n\n        branch_length = parent.height - child.height\n\n   This would be positive because parent.height <= child.height? Actually, no: as we go from the leaf (present) to the root (past), the similarity decreases. So the parent\'s height (similarity) is less than the child\'s (leaf) height? Then branch_length would be negative.\n\n   We want positive branch lengths? The Newick format usually has positive branch lengths.\n\n   Therefore, we can define the distance (branch length) as:\n\n        branch_length = (child.height - parent.height)\n\n   Then the leaf has the highest height (similarity) and the parent has lower. So the branch_length is positive.\n\n   How do we assign the height for a leaf? We can set it to the maximum similarity in the entire matrix? But note: the leaf didn\'t merge at any step, so we don\'t have a merge height. Instead, we can set the leaf height to be the self-similarity? But we don\'t have that. Alternatively, we can set the leaf height to be a fixed value that is higher than any merge? For example, the maximum similarity in the entire matrix plus one? Then:\n\n        leaf_height = max_similarity + 1\n\n   Then the branch length from a leaf to its parent would be: leaf_height - parent.height\n\n   And for an internal node, the branch length to its parent would be: (node.height - parent.height)\n\n   But note: the root node has no parent. In the Newick format, we don\'t assign a branch length to the root.\n\n   However, the requirement for the Newick format with distances: the example includes branch lengths for every node and leaf. So we have to assign.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid assigning a leaf height and instead use the merge heights and then the branch length for a leaf is the difference between the leaf\'s "virtual" height (max_sim) and the parent\'s height? But we don\'t store the leaf height.\n\n   Another idea: we can build the tree without leaf heights and then when writing the Newick, we set the branch length for a leaf to be the difference between the maximum similarity and the parent\'s height? And for internal nodes, the branch length between a node and its parent is the difference between the node\'s height and the parent\'s height.\n\n   But note: the problem says "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number", meaning integers, and they are the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores? But the branch lengths are differences.\n\n   We\'ll do:\n\n        Let maxSimilarity = the maximum value in the similarity matrix (over all pairs) -> but note: the similarity matrix does not include the self-similarity? So we can compute maxSimilarity as the max of all the values we computed.\n\n        For a leaf node, we set its height = maxSimilarity + 1? But then the branch length from the leaf to its parent would be (maxSimilarity+1) - parent.height. However, the problem says the branch lengths should be integers and without decimals.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the leaf node\'s height to maxSimilarity? Then the branch length would be maxSimilarity - parent.height.\n\n        But what if the parent of the leaf was merged at maxSimilarity? Then the branch length would be 0? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n   After reconsidering the requirement: the height of an internal node is the similarity score at which the merge happened. For the dendrogram, we want to plot the leaves at the same level? Actually, the dendrogram will have the leaves aligned and the internal nodes at heights corresponding to the similarity. Then the branch from a leaf to its parent is the drop from the leaf (which we consider to be at the maximum height) to the parent? But the maximum height is the maximum similarity? And the parent is at a lower similarity? Then the branch length in the dendrogram is the difference.\n\n   However, the requirement for the Newick format: we are to write the branch lengths. We can define:\n\n        For a leaf: the branch length is (maxSimilarity - parent.height)\n        For an internal node (non-root) to its parent: (node.height - parent.height)\n        For the root: we don\'t assign a branch length? Actually, the root doesn\'t have a parent, so it doesn\'t have a branch length.\n\n   But in the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" -> here the root has a branch length of 5? Actually, the root has a branch length of 5 to the node that is the parent of (C,D) and the root.\n\n   How about we set the root\'s branch length to 0? Then we can write the root without a branch length? Actually, the Newick format doesn\'t require the root to have a branch length.\n\n   Alternatively, we can represent the tree without branch lengths at the root? The example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5)" -> the root has a branch length of 5? Then the entire subtree (C,D) is connected to the root by a branch of length 5.\n\n   We\'ll do:\n\n        Each node (except the root) has a branch length that is the difference between its own height and its parent\'s height? But wait: the height of a node is the similarity at which it was merged. The parent\'s height is lower (because we merge from high to low). So the branch length would be (node.height - parent.height) and that is positive? Actually, no: node.height is higher than parent.height? Then the branch length would be negative.\n\n   We must use positive lengths? Then we can define: branch_length = (parent.height - node.height) for the node? But that would be positive? And for a leaf, we don\'t have a node.height? So we define the branch length for a leaf as (maxSimilarity - parent.height). And for an internal node, the branch length to its parent is (parent.height - node.height) -> but note: the parent.height is less than node.height? Then it would be negative.\n\n   We have to invert the similarity to get a distance? How about:\n\n        distance = maxSimilarity - similarity\n\n   Then the clustering becomes: we want to merge the two clusters with the smallest distance (because the highest similarity is the smallest distance). Then the tree building is done with distances (minimizing the distance). Then the height of a node in the dendrogram would be the distance (so increasing as we go up). Then the branch lengths are the differences in distance? Then they are positive.\n\n   But the requirement: the tree must be built using the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (as similarity) and the dendrogram must use the raw scores for the x-axis? And the Newick format must use integers without decimals.\n\n   And the problem says: "it is extremely important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wunsch scores".\n\n   So we must keep the raw scores.\n\n   Therefore, we will:\n\n        - Build the tree using similarity (so we merge the two clusters with the highest similarity).\n        - For the Newick format with distances, we will output the branch lengths as the difference in similarity? But that would be negative? We cannot have negative branch lengths.\n\n   We have to represent the tree in such a way that the branch lengths are positive. So we need to transform the similarity into a distance. The transformation: distance = maxSimilarity - similarity.\n\n   Then:\n        For a leaf: we set the leaf\'s distance = 0? Then the branch length from the leaf to its parent would be: (maxSimilarity - parent.similarity) - 0 = maxSimilarity - parent.similarity.\n        For an internal node: the branch length to its parent would be: (maxSimilarity - parent.similarity) - (maxSimilarity - node.similarity) = node.similarity - parent.similarity.\n\n   But note: node.similarity is greater than parent.similarity? Then the branch length is positive.\n\n   And the entire tree is built with the distance = maxSimilarity - similarity. Then the clustering is done by single linkage on the distance? Actually, we built the tree by merging the most similar (so the smallest distance) first? Yes.\n\n   However, the problem says to build the tree using the similarity, not distance. But if we use the transformation to distance, then the tree building algorithm (single linkage) is the same as using the similarity with maximum? Because:\n\n        similarity: we want to merge the two clusters with the maximum similarity (which is the minimum distance).\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        Step 1: Compute a distance matrix: distance(i,j) = maxSimilarity - similarity(i,j)\n\n        Then run hierarchical clustering (single linkage) on the distance matrix.\n\n        Then the height of a node (in terms of similarity) is: maxSimilarity - (distance at which the merge happened)\n\n        But note: the requirement says the node should have a height of the similarity score.\n\n   So we can build the tree by:\n\n        We start with each species as a cluster.\n        We have a distance matrix D (size n x n) where D[i][j] = maxSimilarity - S[i][j] (if i != j), and 0 if i==j? But we don\'t need the diagonal.\n\n        Then we run the standard hierarchical clustering (using single linkage) on D.\n\n        However, the requirement says to use the raw similarity scores in the tree. So we want to store in the node the similarity score at which the merge happened: which is maxSimilarity - d, where d is the distance at which the merge happened.\n\n   Then for the Newick format with distances, we want to output the branch lengths in terms of the distance (which is the same as the difference in similarity? as above). But the problem says: the Newick with distances should use integers without decimals, and the branch lengths are computed from the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores? They don\'t specify if they want the distance or the similarity. But the example in the tree building step: the node for Horse and Dog has a height of 1200 (similarity). In the Newick format, the branch length would be the distance? How is the Newick going to be used? For drawing the dendrogram, we are to use the raw scores for the x-axis? That would be the similarity? But the branch lengths in the Newick are usually used for the horizontal bars? Actually, in a horizontal dendrogram, the vertical axis is the similarity? And the horizontal axis is just the ordering of the leaves? So the branch lengths in the Newick might be ignored for the drawing? Or used for the horizontal spacing? The requirement says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" -> I think they mean the similarity scores? But they say "distances", which is confusing.\n\n   After re-reading: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". But in the context, we have been using similarity. The word "distances" might be a misnomer? Or they mean the scores? The problem says: "Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result" which is a score (could be called a distance or similarity?).\n\n   Given the confusion, we will follow the requirement for the tree building: the node\'s height is the similarity score. For the Newick format with distances, we will output the branch lengths as the differences in similarity scores (with the parent) and then take the absolute value? Or we will use the transformation to distance and output positive integers.\n\n   But the requirement for the Newick format: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number", meaning integers, and they are the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores? But the branch lengths are not the raw scores, they are differences.\n\n   We\'ll output:\n\n        For a leaf: branch_length = (maxSimilarity - parent.similarity)   [positive integer]\n        For an internal node (non-root): branch_length = (node.similarity - parent.similarity)   [positive integer, because node.similarity > parent.similarity]\n\n   And we will store in the node the similarity score.\n\n   And for the dendrogram drawing: we use the similarity score as the x-coordinate?
