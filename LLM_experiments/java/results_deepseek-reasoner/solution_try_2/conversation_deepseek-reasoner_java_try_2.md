## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  

**LLM Response:**

### Project Summary and Outline

**Project Goal:**  
Build a phylogenetic clustering system that processes amino acid sequences to generate species clusters based on evolutionary similarity, visualized through a dendrogram.

**Key Components:**  
1. **Input Data**  
   - Amino acid sequences for multiple species (e.g., FASTA format).

2. **Similarity Calculation**  
   - **Algorithm:** Needleman-Wunsch global alignment.  
   - **Scoring:** Custom substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM/PAM-like scores) + gap penalties.  
   - **Output:** Pairwise similarity scores for all species combinations.

3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**  
   - Convert similarity scores to evolutionary distances.  
   - Build tree using hierarchical clustering (UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining).  
   - Output: Tree structure (rooted, with branch lengths).

4. **Dendrogram Visualization**  
   - Generate a graphical dendrogram from the tree (terminal/text-based or GUI).  
   - Label leaves with species names + scale for distance interpretation.

5. **Threshold-Based Clustering**  
   - Cut tree at user-defined distance thresholds to generate species clusters.  
   - Output cluster memberships (e.g., `{threshold: [cluster1, cluster2]}`).

**Technical Stack:**  
- **Core:** Java 17+  
- **Bioinformatics:** Custom NW implementation (no external libs).  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Option 1: ASCII dendrograms (for CLI).  
  - Option 2: JavaFX/Swing (GUI).  
- **Data:** In-memory structures for scores/trees; file I/O for sequences.

**Critical Dependencies:**  
1. Substitution matrix (provide format/values).  
2. Gap penalty scheme (linear/affine).  
3. Distance conversion method (e.g., `distance = 1 - similarity`).  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Specify substitution matrix and gap penalties.  
2. Confirm tree-building method (UPGMA preferred for simplicity).  
3. Choose visualization approach (CLI vs. GUI).  

**Ready to proceed.**  
üëâ Provide the first task (e.g., substitution matrix format, sequence input method, or NW implementation).

## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called ‚ÄúblosumXX.json‚Äù, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{‚Äúa‚Äù: -1, ‚Äúb‚Äù: -2, ‚Äúab‚Äù: -3, ‚Äúba": -3, ‚Äúaa‚Äù: 2, ‚Äúbb‚Äù: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

### Task Summary: Needleman-Wunsch Implementation  

#### **Input Data**  
1. **`organisms.json`**  
   - Structure: `Map<String, String>`  
   - Key: Species name (e.g., `"Wild boar"`)  
   - Value: Amino acid sequence (e.g., `"MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL"`)  

2. **`blosumXX.json`** (XX = `50` or `62`)  
   - Structure: `Map<String, Integer>`  
   - Key semantics:  
     - Single-character (e.g., `"a"`): **Gap penalty** for deleting/inserting that amino acid.  
     - Two-character (e.g., `"ab"`): **Substitution score** for aligning `a` (Sequence 1) with `b` (Sequence 2).  
   - Example:  
     ```json  
     {"a": -1, "b": -2, "ab": -3, "ba": -3, "aa": 2, "bb": 3}  
     ```  

#### **Core Requirements**  
1. **Algorithm**: Global sequence alignment via Needleman-Wunsch.  
2. **Scoring Logic**:  
   - **Match/Mismatch**: Use two-character keys (e.g., `score("S1[i]", "S2[j]") = matrix.get("ab")`).  
   - **Gaps**: Use single-character keys (e.g., gap penalty for `'a' = matrix.get("a")`).  
3. **Matrix Flexibility**:  
   - Support both `blosum50.json` and `blosum62.json` interchangeably between runs.  
4. **Output**: Pairwise alignment scores for **all species pairs** (symmetric matrix).  

#### **Key Constraints**  
- **Gap Penalty Handling**: Amino acid-specific (not constant).  
- **Substitution Directionality**:  
  - `"ab"` ‚â† `"ba"` in the matrix (must use exact key order).  
- **Sequence Characters**: Assume uppercase amino acid letters (e.g., `A`, `C`, `D`).  

#### **Edge Cases to Address**  
1. Missing keys in BLOSUM matrix (e.g., undefined amino acid `'X'`).  
2. Unequal sequence lengths.  
3. Large species sets ‚Üí Optimize pairwise computations (O(n¬≤)).  

#### **Design Implications**  
- **JSON Parsing**: Use libraries (Jackson/Gson) for efficient deserialization.  
- **Scoring Lookup**: Optimize with `Map<String, Integer>` for O(1) access.  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid redundant computations; stream results if possible.  

#### **Next Steps**  
1. Finalize BLOSUM matrix path resolution logic.  
2. Confirm gap penalty symmetry (same for insertions/deletions).  
3. Define output format for pairwise scores (e.g., `Map<SpeciesPair, Integer>`).  

**Awaiting your directive to start coding.**  
üëâ Specify:  
- Preferred JSON library (Jackson/Gson).  
- Handling of undefined amino acids in BLOSUM.  
- Parallelization strategy for large datasets.
## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from ‚Äúorganism.json‚Äù calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in ‚ÄúblosumXX.json‚Äù file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string ‚Äúaabaab‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies1‚Äù and another string ‚Äúababaa‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies2‚Äù, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

### Solution Overview
The solution involves reading amino acid sequences and a BLOSUM substitution matrix from JSON files, then computing pairwise Needleman-Wunsch alignment scores for all species combinations. Key aspects:
1. **BLOSUM Matrix Handling**: Loads substitution/gap scores from JSON
2. **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm**: Efficient DP implementation with amino acid-specific gap penalties
3. **Similarity Matrix**: Stores scores in a nested map for O(1) access
4. **Input Validation**: Checks for invalid characters and missing scores
5. **Production Readiness**: Error handling, resource management, and Google Java Style compliance

## Prompt 6

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using ‚Äú_‚Äù, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to modify the existing code to add functionality for saving the similarity matrix to a JSON file.\n Steps:\n 1. We will add a method in `SimilarityMatrix` to convert the matrix into a nested map that can be easily serialized to JSON.\n    However, note the requirement: the output JSON should have keys as concatenated species names with "_", and the value as the integer score.\n    Example: {"Wild boar_Horse": 42, ...}\n\n 2. We will create a utility class `JsonUtils` to handle writing a map to a JSON file.\n\n 3. We will modify `Main.java` to:\n    a. Determine the BLOSUM matrix type (50 or 62) from the input filename to generate the output filename.\n    b. After computing the similarity matrix, write it to the appropriate file.\n\n 4. We will add the Jackson dependency for JSON processing (if not already included).\n\n However, note that we are already using Jackson in `BlosumMatrix.java` for reading JSON. So we can use the same for writing.\n\n Let\'s break down the changes:\n\n File 1: `SimilarityMatrix.java` (add a method to export as a flat map with combined keys)\n File 2: Create `JsonUtils.java` for writing JSON to file (optional, but for separation of concerns)\n File 3: Modify `Main.java` to write the output.\n\n But note: the requirement is to have a single key per pair, and the pair is represented by two species names concatenated with "_".\n\n However, note that the similarity matrix is symmetric? But the requirement does not specify if we need both (A_B and B_A). \n But the example output file only has one entry per pair. We will assume that we store each pair only once (and we don\'t care about order?).\n\n But the problem: in the `SimilarityMatrix` class, we store both (A,B) and (B,A) but they are the same? Actually, the algorithm is symmetric? \n Yes, Needleman-Wunsch is symmetric? Actually, it is, because the substitution matrix should be symmetric? But note: the BLOSUM matrix in the example had both "ab" and "ba". \n However, the algorithm uses the substitution score for (a, b) and (b, a) as separate? Actually, in the example they were the same. \n\n But in our code, the `BlosumMatrix` class uses the key formed by `a` (from first sequence) and `b` (from second sequence). So the score for (seq1, seq2) might be different than (seq2, seq1) if the matrix has different values for "ab" and "ba". \n\n However, the example BLOSUM matrix had: "ab": -3, "ba": -3. So they were the same. But what if they are not? Then the algorithm would be asymmetric.\n\n Since the problem states: \n   "Example above says that: deleting \'a\' cost -1; deleting \'b\' cost -2; swapping \'a\' for \'b\' or \'b\' for \'a\' cost -3"\n\n So in the example, swapping is symmetric. But the problem does not require symmetry.\n\n Therefore, we must store both (A_B) and (B_A) if they are different? But the requirement says: "keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using ‚Äú_‚Äù".\n\n And note: the requirement does not specify the order. But in the example test case, we are only given one score for the pair. \n\n However, the problem says: "for each pair of species". It does not specify if we consider ordered pairs or unordered. \n\n But in the test case, we have two species: "testspecies1" and "testspecies2", and we compute one score. \n\n So we will store one entry per unordered pair? But note: the requirement says "concatenating names of the species in the pair", but it doesn\'t specify the order. \n\n Let\'s clarify: the example output key would be "testspecies1_testspecies2". But what if we have the reverse? We don\'t want two entries for the same pair.\n\n Therefore, we will store each unordered pair only once. But how to choose the order? \n\n We can decide to sort the species names alphabetically and then combine them. This way, for a pair (A, B) and (B, A) we always represent it as (min(A,B), max(A,B)) and then form the key.\n\n Alternatively, we can store both orders? But the requirement does not specify.\n\n However, the requirement says: "keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair". It does not specify the order. \n\n But to avoid duplication and to make the file deterministic, we will use alphabetical order for the two species names when forming the key.\n\n How we will do it in the `SimilarityMatrix`:\n\n   We can add a method:\n        public Map<String, Integer> toPairMap() {\n            Map<String, Integer> pairMap = new HashMap<>();\n            for (int i = 0; i < species.size(); i++) {\n                String s1 = species.get(i);\n                for (int j = i+1; j < species.size(); j++) {\n                    String s2 = species.get(j);\n                    String key = s1 + "_" + s2; // but we want consistent order: sort\n                    // Instead, let\'s sort the two strings\n                    String[] pair = {s1, s2};\n                    Arrays.sort(pair);\n                    key = pair[0] + "_" + pair[1];\n                    int score = getScore(s1, s2); // note: getScore(s1,s2) and getScore(s2,s1) are the same? \n                    // Actually, in our current storage, we store both. But we don\'t require them to be symmetric? \n                    // However, the algorithm might not be symmetric? \n                    // But we computed for (s1, s2) and stored in matrix[s1][s2]. We did not compute for (s2, s1) separately? \n                    // Actually, we computed for (s1, s2) and then stored it for both? No, in the current SimilarityMatrix, we only stored one direction? \n                    // Let me check: in Main.java we did:\n                    //   similarityMatrix.addScore(species1, species2, score);\n                    //   and we also did: \n                    //   similarityMatrix.addScore(species2, species1, score);   ??? \n                    // Actually, in the previous code we did not do that. We only stored one way? \n\n                    // We must fix this: the SimilarityMatrix currently only stores for (species1, species2). We did not store for (species2, species1). \n                    // But in the test case, we only need to store one value per unordered pair? \n                    // And in the algorithm, we compute for (species1, species2) and that score is for aligning species1 to species2. \n                    // But if the algorithm is asymmetric, then (species1, species2) might be different from (species2, species1). \n                    // However, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm as implemented is not symmetric? \n                    // Because we have:\n                    //   dp[i][j] = max( ... , delete, insert)\n                    //   and the delete penalty is for the first sequence and insert for the second? \n                    //   and the gap penalties are amino acid specific? \n                    //   so if the sequences are different, then the score for (s1, s2) might be different from (s2, s1).\n\n                    // Therefore, we must store both? But the requirement for the output file: one key per pair? \n                    // And the key is formed by concatenation? Then we have two keys: "A_B" and "B_A", and they might be different.\n\n                    // So we should store both? \n\n                    // The requirement does not specify. But note: the example test case: \n                    //   one string ‚Äúaabaab‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies1‚Äù and another string ‚Äúababaa‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies2‚Äù\n                    //   the output should be 7. \n                    //   and the key would be "testspecies1_testspecies2": 7.\n\n                    // But what about "testspecies2_testspecies1"? The requirement does not say we need both.\n\n                    // However, in the next steps we might need to build a symmetric distance matrix for clustering? \n                    // So we need both? Actually, no, because if the algorithm is asymmetric, then we have a problem.\n\n                    // But in bioinformatics, the alignment is typically symmetric? \n\n                    // Since the problem does not specify, and our algorithm might be asymmetric, we will store both pairs.\n\n                    // But the requirement says: "for each pair of species". This implies both ordered pairs? \n\n                    // Therefore, we will store two entries for each unordered pair? \n\n                    // However, the requirement says: "keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using ‚Äú_‚Äù". \n                    // So for pair (A, B) we have key "A_B", and for (B, A) we have key "B_A".\n\n                    // So we can simply iterate over every ordered pair? \n\n                    // But note: we have stored the similarity matrix as a nested map: \n                    //   matrix: { \n                    //        species1: { species1: ?, species2: score12, ... },\n                    //        species2: { species1: score21, ... }\n                    //   }\n\n                    // And we computed every ordered pair? \n\n                    // In the previous step, we computed for every ordered pair? Actually, we did:\n\n                    //   for (int i = 0; i < speciesList.size(); i++) {\n                    //        for (int j = 0; j < speciesList.size(); j++) {\n                    //            if (i == j) ...? \n                    //        }\n                    //   }\n\n                    // But in the previous code, we did not have the inner loop? \n\n                    // Actually, in the previous code, we did not generate the `Main` class. So let me recall: we only generated the data structures and the algorithm.\n\n                    // We need to generate the main logic now.\n\n                    // We are going to modify `Main` to compute every ordered pair? \n\n                    // The requirement: "for each pair of species" - this typically means every unordered pair? But the problem does not specify.\n\n                    // However, the example test case only had one pair. \n\n                    // But to be safe, we will compute for every ordered pair (including (i,j) and (j,i))? \n\n                    // However, note that the algorithm is not symmetric? So we must compute both.\n\n                    // Therefore, we will compute for every ordered pair? \n\n                    // But the requirement says "each pair", which might be interpreted as unordered? \n\n                    // But the problem also says: "these results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers". \n\n                    // We are computing for every ordered pair. \n\n                    // Therefore, in the output JSON, we will have two entries for two different orders? \n\n                    // So the output JSON will look like:\n                    //   {\n                    //      "species1_species2": 100,\n                    //      "species2_species1": 105,\n                    //      ...\n                    //   }\n\n                    // This is acceptable.\n\n                    // How to generate the map for serialization? We can iterate over every species and then every other species (including same) but the problem says "pair" so we exclude same? \n                    // Actually, the requirement does not say if we need the same species? But the algorithm: aligning a species to itself? \n                    // We did not say we skip the diagonal. \n\n                    // The requirement: "for each pair of species" - typically does not include the same species? But the example test case had two different species.\n\n                    // But the problem does not specify. So we will include the same species? \n\n                    // However, the same species: (A, A) is a valid pair? \n\n                    // We can compute the score for (A, A) and that should be the best possible alignment? \n\n                    // So we will compute for every ordered pair including (i,i) and (i,j) for i != j.\n\n                    // Therefore, we will have N x N entries.\n\n                    // How to iterate: \n                    //   for (String s1 : species) {\n                    //        for (String s2 : species) {\n                    //            String key = s1 + "_" + s2;\n                    //            int score = similarityMatrix.getScore(s1, s2);\n                    //            put in map.\n                    //        }\n                    //   }\n\n                    // But note: in the `SimilarityMatrix` class, we currently do not store the diagonal? We did in the constructor initialize for every species, but we didn\'t add the score for (s1, s1). \n\n                    // Actually, in the previous code, we did not generate the main loop. So we have to generate the main loop now.\n\n                    // So we will do the double loop in `Main` and store every ordered pair.\n\n                    // Therefore, in the `SimilarityMatrix` class, we have stored every ordered pair? \n\n                    // We did: \n                    //   public void addScore(String species1, String species2, int score) {\n                    //        matrix.get(species1).put(species2, score);\n                    //   }\n\n                    // So we can get any (species1, species2).\n\n                    // Therefore, we can generate the map for serialization by iterating over every species1 and every species2.\n\n        }\n\n        We will not change the `SimilarityMatrix` class for now? We can add a method to export a Map<String, Integer> for the entire matrix (with keys as "s1_s2"):\n\n        public Map<String, Integer> toSerializableMap() {\n            Map<String, Integer> result = new HashMap<>();\n            for (String s1 : matrix.keySet()) {\n                for (String s2 : matrix.get(s1).keySet()) {\n                    String key = s1 + "_" + s2;\n                    result.put(key, matrix.get(s1).get(s2));\n                }\n            }\n            return result;\n        }\n\n        But note: we also have the diagonal? And we computed for every pair? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        public Map<String, Integer> toSerializableMap() {\n            Map<String, Integer> result = new HashMap<>();\n            for (String s1 : species) {\n                for (String s2 : species) {\n                    String key = s1 + "_" + s2;\n                    result.put(key, matrix.get(s1).get(s2));\n                }\n            }\n            return result;\n        }\n\n        But this will include every pair? \n\n        However, we might not have computed all? We computed every pair? Yes, in the main loop we will compute every pair.\n\n        So we will do this.\n\n 5. Now, we will create a utility class for writing JSON? Or we can do it in `Main`? \n\n    We can create a simple method in `Main`? But for reusability, we can create a `JsonUtils` class.\n\n 6. We will add a class `JsonUtils`:\n\n    package com.example.project;\n\n    import java.io.File;\n    import java.io.IOException;\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\n    public final class JsonUtils {\n        private static final ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n        public static void writeMapToJson(Map<?, ?> map, File file) throws IOException {\n            mapper.writeValue(file, map);\n        }\n    }\n\n 7. Now, in `Main.java` we will:\n\n    - Read the organisms.json and the blosumXX.json (the path of blosumXX.json will be provided as an argument? Or fixed? We need to decide the input method)\n\n    But the problem says: "this should be able to execute using two different blosumXX.json files". So we need to specify the BLOSUM file at runtime.\n\n    We will assume the program takes two command-line arguments:\n\n        arg0: path to organisms.json\n        arg1: path to blosumXX.json (e.g., blosum50.json or blosum62.json)\n\n    Then, we extract the XX from the filename to form the output filename.\n\n    Steps in `Main`:\n\n        String organismsPath = args[0];\n        String blosumPath = args[1];\n\n        // Extract the blosum type from the filename: \n        //   Example: "blosum50.json" -> "50", then output filename = "organisms_scores_blosum50.json"\n        String blosumType = ...; // extract the number from the filename\n\n        // Read organisms.json -> Map<String, String>\n        // Read blosum matrix -> BlosumMatrix\n\n        // Compute the similarity matrix for every ordered pair of species\n\n        // Write the similarity matrix to a file: "organisms_scores_blosum"+blosumType+".json"\n\n 8. We have to generate the `Main` class.\n\n Let\'s write the `Main` class.\n\n However, note: we haven\'t provided the `Main` class in the previous step. So we have to generate it from scratch.\n\n But the previous step only generated the supporting classes.\n\n We will now generate the `Main` class and the other changes.\n\n 9. We must consider error handling and logging.\n\n 10. We must close resources.\n\n Let\'s generate the code.\n\n Note: We are using Jackson, so we need to add the dependency in the pom.xml.\n\n But the requirement says: we can choose libraries freely, and we are using Maven.\n\n We are using Jackson for JSON. We\'ll use the same version for all.\n\n We\'ll update the pom.xml (if we haven\'t already). Since we are generating code, we can also generate the pom.xml? \n\n But the instruction says: "When providing me a code samples or scripts, always include name of the file in which the code should be put".\n\n We haven\'t generated the pom.xml yet. But the instruction only asked for the first task. We can generate the pom.xml now? \n\n However, the instruction says: "this is only the first task of the project". So we can generate the pom.xml in the next step? \n\n But we need Jackson now. So let\'s generate the pom.xml as well.\n\n But the instruction did not ask for the pom.xml? \n\n Alternatively, we can note that the pom.xml should include:\n\n    <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>\n            <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>\n            <version>2.15.0</version>\n        </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n\n And the build plugin for Google style? \n\n But the requirement says: Google Java Style Guide.\n\n We can use the plugin:\n\n    <plugin>\n        <groupId>com.coveo</groupId>\n        <artifactId>fmt-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>2.19</version>\n        <executions>\n            <execution>\n                <goals>\n                    <goal>format</goal>\n                </goals>\n            </execution>\n        </exec'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4452, 'total_tokens': 8548, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2880}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2880, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 1572}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'ae273b18-4ef6-47a6-acfe-5f461eb5bfd0', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--f4860483-31e9-465c-a154-a32518121d52-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4452, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8548, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2880}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are moving to the second task: building a phylogenetic tree using the similarity scores from the first task.\n\nKey points from the instruction:\n1. **Goal**: Build a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) from the similarity scores (Needleman-Wunsch scores) that we computed and stored in the previous step.\n2. **Method**: Agglomerative hierarchical clustering with a twist. We are using similarity scores (higher is better) rather than distances (lower is better). \n   - Since most libraries operate on distances, we must convert similarity to distance appropriately. However, note the instruction says: "It is extremely important to come up with a solution that operates on similarity scores" because later steps will use the raw scores. \n   - This implies that the tree building process must internally use the similarity scores and not convert to distance if that would lose the original score values. But note: the agglomerative clustering typically requires a distance (dissimilarity) measure. We have to be cautious.\n\n3. **Clustering Strategy**: The instruction says "we\'ll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score". This is equivalent to using a distance measure defined as `distance = (max_similarity - similarity)` so that the highest similarity becomes the smallest distance. However, note that the instruction says later steps will use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores. Therefore, we must store the raw similarity at the time of merging.\n\n4. **Tree Structure Requirements**:\n   - The tree will have internal nodes representing common ancestors and leaves as the species.\n   - The root is the last common ancestor (origin of life).\n   - We must store the tree in a way that preserves the similarity scores (as branch lengths? or as node attributes?) because:\n        a. We will need to generate clusters by cutting the tree at given thresholds (which are in the original similarity score units).\n        b. We will need to output the tree in Newick format (which can include branch lengths and node labels).\n\n5. **Threshold-based Clustering**: \n   - The thresholds will be chosen from the range of the original similarity scores (e.g., from the min to max of the Needleman-Wunsch scores). \n   - When we cut the tree at a threshold T, we want clusters such that within a cluster, the similarity between any two species is at least T? But note: in hierarchical clustering with single linkage, the clusters are connected components above the threshold. However, the instruction does not specify the linkage method beyond "single linkage methodology" but then says we are merging the highest similarity first. \n\n   Clarification: \n   - Single linkage: the distance between two clusters is the minimum distance (or maximum similarity) between any two points in the clusters. \n   - We are merging the two clusters that have the highest similarity (i.e., the maximum similarity between any two elements in the two clusters). This is exactly single linkage with similarity.\n\n   However, note: when converting to distance, we can define the distance between two clusters as `max_similarity - s`, where `s` is the similarity between two elements. Then we would merge clusters with the smallest distance. But the instruction says we are to use the similarity directly.\n\n   We must design the clustering to use the similarity and merge the two clusters that have the highest similarity (i.e., the maximum similarity between any two elements in the two clusters). This is single linkage with similarity.\n\n6. **Output Requirements**:\n   - The tree must be stored in a data structure that allows:\n        - Saving in Newick format (for the dendrogram).\n        - Cutting at arbitrary thresholds (in the original similarity units) to produce clusters.\n\n7. **Implementation Plan**:\n   - We\'ll implement the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm using the similarity matrix.\n   - We\'ll represent the tree with nodes that store:\n        - The children (for internal nodes) or the leaf species (for leaves).\n        - The similarity score at which the node was created (the similarity of the two clusters being merged).\n        - The branch lengths? Actually, in the Newick format we might need branch lengths. However, the instruction does not specify how to set branch lengths. \n\n   Important: The typical way to set branch lengths in a phylogenetic tree built by UPGMA or neighbor-joining is by the distance. But note: we are using similarity and we are doing single linkage. \n\n   However, the instruction says: "Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life." and that we are building from the bottom up.\n\n   We can use the similarity score to set the height of the node? In a dendrogram, the height of a node is often the distance (or dissimilarity) at which the clusters are merged. But in our case, we want to use the similarity. So we might set the height of the node to be the similarity score? But note: the root would then have the highest similarity? That doesn\'t match because the root should be the oldest and have the lowest similarity? \n\n   Actually, we are building a tree where the leaves are the present-day species and the root is the common ancestor. The similarity between two species is highest when they are most closely related. When we merge two clusters, we use the highest similarity (i.e., the closest relationship) between any two members of the clusters.\n\n   How to represent the tree?\n   - The Newick format typically uses branch lengths that represent evolutionary distance (time). But we don\'t have time, we have similarity. We are going to use the similarity scores as the basis for the branch lengths? \n\n   The instruction says: "draw a dendrogram representing this tree". The dendrogram should have the leaves at the bottom and the root at the top. The vertical axis is the similarity at which clusters are merged. Since we are merging the most similar first, those merges will be at a high similarity (close to the leaves). The merges of less similar clusters will be at lower similarities (closer to the root). \n\n   Therefore, we can represent the node height as the similarity score. Then the dendrogram would have the root at the bottom (lowest similarity) and the leaves at the top? But that\'s upside down. \n\n   Alternatively, we can use a transformation: let the height of a node be (max_similarity - similarity) so that the leaves are at height 0 and the root is at height (max_similarity - min_similarity). Then the dendrogram would look like a tree with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom. But note: the instruction does not specify the orientation.\n\n   However, the Newick format does not dictate the orientation. It just stores the tree topology and branch lengths.\n\n   Important: The instruction says that later we will cut the tree at thresholds that are in the original similarity scores. So we must preserve the similarity scores at the nodes.\n\n   Proposed representation for the tree node:\n   - Each node (leaf or internal) has:\n        - A label (for leaves: the species name; for internal: we can generate an id or leave it without a label?).\n        - The similarity score at which the node was created (for the internal nodes, this is the similarity of the two clusters that were merged; for leaves, we can set it to a very high value? or not set?).\n        - The children and the parent? (we\'ll need to traverse the tree)\n\n   But note: when we merge two clusters, the similarity of the new cluster to other clusters is defined by the single linkage: the maximum similarity between any element of the new cluster and any element of the other cluster.\n\n   Steps for clustering:\n   - Start with each species as a cluster.\n   - Find the two clusters with the highest similarity (by checking all pairs of clusters: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two species in the two clusters).\n   - Merge them into a new cluster. The new cluster\'s similarity to other clusters is the maximum similarity between any species in the new cluster and any species in the other cluster.\n\n   We need a data structure to store the similarity between clusters. We can use a priority queue to efficiently get the highest similarity.\n\n   We will represent the tree with a class `PhylogeneticTree` and a class `TreeNode`.\n\n   The `TreeNode` will have:\n   - `left` and `right` (the two children, for internal nodes; for leaves, these are null and we store the species name)\n   - `similarity` (the similarity at which this node was created, i.e., the similarity of the two clusters that were merged to form this node. For leaves, we don\'t have a merge, so we can set it to `Double.NaN`? But we might want to set the leaf similarity to a value that is higher than any internal node? Actually, the leaf doesn\'t have a merge event. We don\'t need to store a similarity for the leaf. Instead, we can store the height of the node? The height of the leaf is 0? and the height of the internal node is the similarity? But wait: we want to cut the tree at a similarity threshold. The merge event happens at a particular similarity. So the internal node should store that similarity.\n\n   The Newick format for a tree might look like:\n   `(A:0.1, B:0.1):0.05` \n   where the branch from the parent to A is 0.1 and to B is 0.1, and the parent node has a branch length of 0.05 to its parent.\n\n   How do we assign branch lengths?\n   - The branch length from a node to its child is the difference in the similarity between the node and the child\'s merge event? \n\n   Actually, the typical way in UPGMA is to set the branch length as half the distance between the clusters. But we are using similarity and single linkage.\n\n   Since the instruction does not specify how to set branch lengths, we can set the branch lengths arbitrarily? But note: the dendrogram drawing and the threshold-based clustering rely on the similarity values.\n\n   For clustering: \n   - We want to cut the tree at a threshold T. That means we cut the tree at a height T (if we represent the tree with the root at the bottom and the leaves at the top, then we draw a horizontal line at T and consider the clusters as the connected components above the line). But in our representation, the height of a node is the similarity at which it was merged. We would cut at T: we break the tree at every edge where the parent node\'s similarity is below T and the child node\'s similarity is above T? \n\n   Actually, the clusters are the subtrees that are above the threshold. We traverse from the root downward until we hit a node with similarity less than T, then we take the subtree above that node as a cluster.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store the tree such that each node has a `height` which is the similarity of the merge event. Then the root has the lowest similarity and the leaves have the highest (conceptually). Then when we cut at T (which is a high value), we get the clusters that were merged at a similarity above T.\n\n   How to assign branch lengths for Newick? \n   - We can set the branch length from a node to its child as the difference between the node\'s height (similarity) and the child\'s height. But note: the child might be a leaf, which doesn\'t have a height. We can set the leaf height to a fixed value? Or we can set the leaf height to the maximum similarity? \n\n   Actually, we don\'t have a natural way to set the branch lengths. The instruction does not specify. Therefore, we might output the Newick tree without branch lengths? But the instruction says "draw a dendrogram", and the Newick format typically includes branch lengths.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the branch lengths arbitrarily to 1? But that would not reflect the similarity differences.\n\n   After re-reading: the instruction says that the thresholds are chosen from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores. So the tree must be built in such a way that the node heights (in the dendrogram) are the similarity scores. Therefore, the branch lengths are not directly used for the threshold cutting. The threshold is applied on the node height (the similarity at which the node was formed).\n\n   Therefore, we can set the branch lengths in the Newick tree as the difference in the similarity between the node and its parent? \n\n   Let:\n   - For a leaf, the height (similarity) is set to a base value? We don\'t have a base value. The leaf doesn\'t have a merge event. We can set the leaf\'s height to the maximum similarity that we observed in the entire matrix? But that might not be consistent.\n\n   Another approach: \n   - We can set the height of a leaf to 0. Then the height of an internal node is the similarity at which it was merged. Then the branch length from an internal node to a leaf would be the node\'s height (since the leaf is at 0). But that would put the leaves at 0 and the root at the top (with the lowest similarity) and the branches would be long for the root? \n\n   This might be acceptable. Then the Newick branch length from node to child would be (parent_height - child_height). For a leaf, the child_height is 0. For an internal node, the child_height is the height of the child node.\n\n   Example:\n   - Suppose we have two species A and B with similarity 10. We merge them at similarity 10. The leaf A and B are at height 0. The internal node AB is at height 10. Then the branch from AB to A is 10-0=10, and to B is 10.\n\n   Then if we have another species C, and we merge AB with C at similarity 5. The new node ABC is at height 5. The branch from ABC to AB is 10-5=5, and to C is 5-0=5.\n\n   Then the Newick string for ABC would be: `((A:10, B:10)AB:5, C:5)ABC;`\n\n   But note: the entire tree height is 5? and the leaves are at 0? Then the dendrogram would have the leaves at 0 and the root at 5? But we want the leaves at the bottom and the root at the top? We can invert the axis? \n\n   Alternatively, we can set the root at 0 and the leaves at negative values? That doesn\'t help.\n\n   Actually, the typical dendrogram has the leaves at the same level (say 0) and the internal nodes at increasing heights (representing the distance). But we are using similarity. We want the leaves to be at the top (high similarity) and the root at the bottom (low similarity). \n\n   How about we set the height of a node as (max_similarity - similarity) so that the leaf is at height 0 (if we set max_similarity = the similarity of the leaf, which doesn\'t exist) or we set the leaf at height = max_similarity? Then the internal node would be at a lower height? Then the branch length would be the difference in height? \n\n   But the instruction says the thresholds are in the original similarity. So if we set the node\'s height as (max_similarity - similarity), then the threshold T would become (max_similarity - T) in the tree. \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me re-think: \n   - We have a similarity matrix. We want to build a tree. The clustering algorithm is:\n        while there is more than one cluster:\n            find the two clusters with the highest similarity (say S)\n            merge them and create a new node with similarity S\n            update the similarity matrix for the new cluster\n\n   The dendrogram is drawn such that the leaves are at the bottom and the root at the top. The vertical axis is labeled with the similarity at which the merge happened. So the merge event for two leaves happens at a high similarity (close to the leaves) and the merge event for two large clusters happens at a low similarity (closer to the root). \n\n   Therefore, the vertical axis is the similarity. The branch from an internal node to its child is drawn from the node (at similarity = S) down to the child. If the child is a leaf, we draw it down to the bottom? But the leaf doesn\'t have a similarity? We can draw the leaf at the bottom (say at similarity = -infinity? or at a fixed baseline). \n\n   Actually, the dendrogram doesn\'t require the leaves to be at a particular similarity. The leaves are at the bottom. The internal nodes are placed at the height corresponding to the similarity of the merge. The branch from the internal node to a leaf is drawn from the node (at height = similarity) down to the leaf (at the bottom). The branch from the internal node to another internal node is drawn from the node (at its similarity) to the child node (at the child\'s similarity). \n\n   Therefore, we can store the tree with:\n      - Each leaf has only a name.\n      - Each internal node has:\n          left, right: the two children (which can be leaf or internal)\n          similarity: the similarity at which it was created.\n\n   Then when writing the Newick tree, we can set the branch length from a node to its child as (node_similarity - child_similarity). For a leaf, the child_similarity is undefined. We can set the leaf\'s similarity to a value? We don\'t have that. \n\n   Alternatively, we can set the leaf\'s similarity to a fixed value, say 0. Then the branch from an internal node to a leaf would be (node_similarity - 0) = node_similarity. But that would not be consistent because the internal node might have been created at a very high similarity, so the branch would be long.\n\n   But note: the leaf doesn\'t have a merge event. The branch from the leaf to its parent should represent the evolutionary change? We don\'t have that information.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, and since the instruction does not specify how to compute branch lengths, we might output the tree without branch lengths? But the instruction says "Newick format", which typically has branch lengths.\n\n   We have two options:\n   Option 1: Set the leaf branch length to 0 and the internal branch length to the difference between the parent\'s similarity and the child\'s similarity (for an internal child) or the parent\'s similarity (for a leaf child). But then the root would have no branch length? We can set the root branch length to 0.\n\n   Option 2: Use the similarity scores as the branch lengths? Then the entire tree would be built with branch lengths in the same units as the similarity. But that would be arbitrary.\n\n   After careful thought, the most common practice in single linkage clustering for dendrograms is to use the merge height (the similarity) as the position for the node and then the branch to the child is the difference between the node\'s height and the child\'s height. For leaves, we set the child\'s height to 0. \n\n   Then the branch length for a leaf is the entire similarity of the merge event? That doesn\'t seem right because two leaves that are merged at similarity 100 would each have a branch of 100, meaning they are very distant? But they are similar.\n\n   Actually'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4880, 'total_tokens': 8976, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 4416}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 4416, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 464}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'e959f6a0-a7ac-4bf2-be48-96ef6bc894d0', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--34246f07-31fe-4adc-91d0-3899ca38b85a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4880, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8976, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 4416}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

### Solution Overview
We'll implement hierarchical clustering with single linkage using similarity scores (higher = more similar). The tree will be built by iteratively merging the most similar clusters, creating internal nodes with heights equal to the similarity score at merge time. This tree structure will support future dendrogram visualization and Newick format serialization.

## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

### Solution Overview
We'll add Newick format serialization capabilities to the phylogenetic tree implementation. The solution includes:
1. **Two Newick Formats**:
   - Basic format with leaf names only
   - Extended format with integer branch lengths
2. **File Naming Convention**: Uses BLOSUM version in filenames
3. **Branch Length Calculation**: Based on node heights (similarity scores)
4. **Recursive Tree Traversal**: Efficient serialization

Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to use the JFreeChart library for drawing the dendrogram because it is a mature and flexible charting library for Java.\n Since the project uses Maven, we can add the dependency in the pom.xml.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Add JFreeChart dependency to pom.xml.\n 2. Create a class to generate the dendrogram as a horizontal bar chart.\n 3. The x-axis will represent the similarity scores (Needleman-Wunsch distances) and the y-axis will show the species and clusters.\n 4. We need to traverse the tree to collect the necessary data for the chart: the leaf order and the branch lengths (which are based on the node heights).\n\n However, note: the tree we built has internal nodes with heights (similarity scores). The branch length from a node to its parent is the difference in heights (parent height - node height). But in our case, the root has the highest similarity and leaves have 0.\n\n We are going to create a custom dataset for JFreeChart\'s CategoryPlot. We\'ll use a DefaultCategoryDataset and render it as a horizontal bar chart.\n\n But note: JFreeChart does not have a built-in dendrogram plot. We can simulate a dendrogram by using a horizontal bar chart and connecting the bars. Alternatively, we can use the JFreeChart\'s org.jfree.chart.plot.CombinedDomainCategoryPlot or custom drawing.\n\n However, after research, there is a DendrogramPlot in the JFreeChart experimental package (org.jfree.experimental.chart.plot.dendrogram) but it is not in the main distribution.\n\n Considering the requirement and simplicity, we can draw the dendrogram using a horizontal bar chart with lines connecting the bars. But this is complex.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following approach:\n\n We\'ll create a custom renderer that draws the dendrogram. But this is a significant task.\n\n Given the complexity, we can use an alternative: output the tree in Newick format and use an external tool to visualize? But the requirement is to generate a PNG file.\n\n We decide to use the JFreeChart and create a custom drawing. We will:\n\n - Traverse the tree to get the leaf order and the positions of the internal nodes.\n - Calculate the x-coordinate for each node (which is the node\'s height, i.e., similarity score).\n - Calculate the y-coordinate for the leaves (evenly spaced) and for internal nodes (midpoint between children).\n\n We will use a JPanel to draw the dendrogram manually and save it as PNG.\n\n However, to keep the project self-contained and avoid external dependencies for visualization (other than JFreeChart which we are already using for charting), we can use the following:\n\n We can use the `org.jfree.chart.ChartFactory` to create a line chart and then customize it to look like a dendrogram? It might be easier to use Java2D directly.\n\n Considering time, we choose to use a simple Swing component to draw the dendrogram and save it as PNG.\n\n Steps for drawing:\n\n 1. Calculate the layout of the tree (assign x and y coordinates to every node).\n 2. Use a JPanel to draw lines connecting the nodes.\n 3. Save the JPanel as an image.\n\n We\'ll create a class `DendrogramPanel` that extends `JPanel` and draws the tree.\n\n We\'ll also create a utility class to save the panel as PNG.\n\n But note: the tree structure is built with `PhyloNode`.\n\n Let\'s break down:\n\n - We need to compute the layout (x, y) for each node in the tree.\n   - x: the node\'s height (similarity score) scaled to fit the panel width.\n   - y: for leaves, we assign a fixed vertical position (evenly spaced). For internal nodes, the y is the midpoint of the children.\n\n We\'ll do a depth-first traversal to assign y positions to leaves and then compute internal nodes.\n\n However, we must note: the tree is binary.\n\n Implementation:\n\n 1. Traverse the tree to collect the leaves in order (left to right). This will determine the vertical positions.\n 2. Assign to each leaf an index (from 0 to n-1) and then the y coordinate = index * (vertical spacing).\n 3. For internal nodes, the y coordinate is the average of the y coordinates of the leaves in the subtree.\n\n But note: the height (x coordinate) of a node is the similarity score at which it was created.\n\n We are going to create:\n\n   class TreeLayout {\n        Map<PhyloNode, Point2D> nodePositions;\n        List<String> leafOrder;\n   }\n\n 4. Then we draw the tree by drawing lines from each node to its two children (if any) at the positions.\n\n Since we are saving to PNG, we must set the size of the image appropriately.\n\n We\'ll create:\n\n   DendrogramDrawer: responsible for computing the layout and drawing the tree.\n\n 5. We\'ll also label the leaves.\n\n Due to the complexity, we\'ll create a separate class for this.\n\n Let\'s create:\n\n   - `DendrogramDrawer.java`: computes the layout and draws the dendrogram.\n   - `TreeLayout.java`: holds the layout information (node positions, leaf order, etc.)\n\n However, to keep it simple, we can do:\n\n   We\'ll create a class `Dendrogram` that has a method to draw the tree and save to file.\n\n Steps:\n\n   public class Dendrogram {\n        public static void saveAsPng(PhyloNode root, String filename, int width, int height) {\n            // Compute layout\n            // Create BufferedImage\n            // Draw on the image\n            // Save as PNG\n        }\n   }\n\n We are going to use Java2D.\n\n Steps in `saveAsPng`:\n\n   1. Determine the number of leaves (to set the vertical spacing).\n   2. Traverse the tree to assign y positions to leaves (in-order traversal to get the leaf order).\n   3. Assign x positions: the node\'s height (which is the similarity score) but note: the root has the highest score and leaves have 0. We need to scale the x-axis so that the root is at the rightmost and leaves at the left? Actually, the requirement says: "x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". And the dendrogram is horizontal. So we want the leaves to be at the left (x=0) and the root at the right (x = max similarity). But in our tree, the leaves have height=0 and the root has the highest similarity. So we can set:\n\n        x = (node.getHeight())   // without inversion?\n\n    However, in a typical dendrogram, the leaves are at the bottom (for vertical) or left (for horizontal) and the root is at the top/right. The branch length is the difference in height. But in our case, the node\'s height is the similarity at which the merge happened. So the root has the highest similarity.\n\n    We want to plot:\n\n        leaf: (0, y)\n        internal node: (node.getHeight(), y)\n\n    But then the line from the leaf to its parent would be from (0, y) to (parent.getHeight(), parentY) and then to the other child.\n\n    However, the parent\'s y is the midpoint of the two children.\n\n    The horizontal axis represents the similarity score (from 0 to max).\n\n    We don\'t need to invert the axis.\n\n   4. Scale the x and y to fit the image.\n\n   However, the raw scores might be in the thousands and the number of leaves might be large. We need to scale.\n\n   5. We\'ll compute:\n\n        xScale = (width - leftMargin - rightMargin) / (maxX - minX)   [minX=0, maxX = root.getHeight()]\n\n        yScale = (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (numberOfLeaves - 1)   [but we want to spread the leaves]\n\n   Actually, for y, we assign each leaf an index from 0 to n-1, and then the internal nodes get a fractional index (average of children). Then we map the index to y coordinate.\n\n   6. Then we draw lines for each node to its children.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We\'ll do:\n\n        Map<PhyloNode, Double> leafIndexMap;   // for leaves: index from 0 to n-1\n        Map<PhyloNode, Double> nodeYMap;       // the actual y coordinate in the image (computed from index and scaled)\n\n        For leaves, we assign an index (by in-order traversal) and then the y coordinate = topMargin + index * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1)\n\n        For internal nodes, the index is the average of the indices of the leaves in the subtree? Actually, we can compute the index as the average of the indices of the two children (if we assign indices to children).\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        We traverse the tree to assign to each node the set of leaves in its subtree? Then the index of the node is the average of the min and max leaf index in the subtree? But that is more complex.\n\n   We can do a recursive method that returns the min and max leaf index in the subtree. Then the node\'s y = (min+max)/2.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        assignLeafIndices(root, currentIndex) -> returns next available index and also sets the leaf index for the leaf.\n\n        Then for internal nodes, we can compute the min and max index from the children.\n\n   We\'ll create:\n\n        class LayoutInfo {\n            double minIndex;\n            double maxIndex;\n            double x;  // the node\'s height (raw)\n            double y;  // in the image, we will map the index to y\n        }\n\n   Then we traverse the tree to assign the minIndex and maxIndex for each node.\n\n   For a leaf:\n\n        minIndex = currentIndex\n        maxIndex = currentIndex\n        currentIndex++\n\n   For an internal node:\n\n        minIndex = min(left.minIndex, right.minIndex)\n        maxIndex = max(left.maxIndex, right.maxIndex)\n        then the node\'s index = (minIndex + maxIndex) / 2.0\n\n   Then we can map:\n\n        x = node.getHeight()\n        y = (minIndex + maxIndex) / 2.0   [this is the index, then we map to image y]\n\n   Then we draw:\n\n        For an internal node to left child: \n            line from (node.x, node.y) to (leftChild.x, leftChild.y) and then to (leftChild.x, leftChild.y) is not the same as the child\'s node? Actually, we have to draw two segments:\n\n            from (node.x, node.y) to (node.x, leftChild.y)   [horizontal? no, vertical?] \n            then from (node.x, leftChild.y) to (leftChild.x, leftChild.y)\n\n        But wait: we want horizontal dendrogram? The requirement says horizontally.\n\n        In a horizontal dendrogram, the leaves are on the left and the root on the right. The branches go horizontally? Actually, the branches are drawn with horizontal and vertical lines.\n\n        We draw:\n\n          For a node and its child:\n\n            - Draw a horizontal line from (child.x, child.y) to (node.x, child.y)\n            - Then a vertical line from (node.x, child.y) to (node.x, node.y)\n\n        But then from the node to the other child similarly.\n\n        Then from the node to its parent? Actually, we are drawing from the node to the children.\n\n        We do a recursive drawing: for each internal node, we draw:\n\n            drawLine(node.x, leftChild.y, node.x, rightChild.y)   [vertical line at x=node.x from leftChild.y to rightChild.y]\n            drawLine(leftChild.x, leftChild.y, node.x, leftChild.y)   [horizontal line for left child]\n            drawLine(rightChild.x, rightChild.y, node.x, rightChild.y)   [horizontal line for right child]\n\n        And then recursively draw the children.\n\n        But note: the root has no parent, so we don\'t draw above it.\n\n   7. We also draw the leaf labels at (0, leaf.y) or slightly offset.\n\n Given the complexity, we\'ll implement:\n\n   - A recursive method to assign the leaf indices and the min/max for each node.\n   - Then compute the actual pixel coordinates.\n\n   We\'ll create a class `TreeLayout` that does the layout.\n\n   Then we draw the tree on a `Graphics2D` object.\n\n Let\'s create:\n\n   `Dendrogram.java`: contains the method to draw and save the dendrogram.\n\n   We\'ll add this to the project.\n\n However, note: the requirement is to save to a PNG file. We\'ll use `javax.imageio.ImageIO`.\n\n Steps:\n\n   BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB);\n   Graphics2D g2 = image.createGraphics();\n   // set background, anti-aliasing\n   // draw the tree\n   // draw labels\n   ImageIO.write(image, "PNG", new File(filename));\n\n We are going to create:\n\n   class Dendrogram {\n        public static void drawDendrogram(PhyloNode root, String filename, int width, int height) {\n            // Step 1: Compute the layout (minIndex, maxIndex, x, y for each node) and assign leaf indices.\n            // Step 2: Map the layout to image coordinates.\n            // Step 3: Draw the tree.\n        }\n   }\n\n Due to the complexity and the fact that this is a production project, we must ensure the code is clean and efficient.\n\n Considering the time, we will implement a simplified version.\n\n Implementation details:\n\n   We\'ll create a helper class `NodeLayout`:\n\n        private static class NodeLayout {\n            PhyloNode node;\n            double x;   // in data space: similarity score\n            double y;   // in data space: the index (average of leaf indices)\n            NodeLayout left;\n            NodeLayout right;\n            double minIndex;\n            double maxIndex;\n        }\n\n   We\'ll do:\n\n        Map<PhyloNode, NodeLayout> nodeLayoutMap = new HashMap<>();\n\n   Then we traverse the tree to assign the indices.\n\n   We\'ll do a recursive method:\n\n        private static NodeLayout createLayout(PhyloNode node, AtomicInteger leafCounter) {\n            if (node == null) return null;\n\n            NodeLayout layout = new NodeLayout();\n            layout.node = node;\n            layout.x = node.getHeight();\n\n            if (node.isLeaf()) {\n                layout.minIndex = leafCounter.get();\n                layout.maxIndex = leafCounter.get();\n                leafCounter.incrementAndGet();\n            } else {\n                NodeLayout leftLayout = createLayout(node.getLeft(), leafCounter);\n                NodeLayout rightLayout = createLayout(node.getRight(), leafCounter);\n                layout.left = leftLayout;\n                layout.right = rightLayout;\n                layout.minIndex = Math.min(leftLayout.minIndex, rightLayout.minIndex);\n                layout.maxIndex = Math.max(leftLayout.maxIndex, rightLayout.maxIndex);\n            }\n            layout.y = (layout.minIndex + layout.maxIndex) / 2.0;\n\n            return layout;\n        }\n\n   Then we have the root layout.\n\n   Then we map to image coordinates:\n\n        double minX = 0;   // the leaves have x=0, but actually the leaves have x=0? \n        // Actually, the leaves have height=0, so x=0. The root has the maximum x.\n\n        double maxX = rootLayout.x;   // the root\'s height\n\n        The number of leaves = leafCounter.get() -> n\n\n        For each node:\n\n            imgX = leftMargin + (nodeLayout.x - minX) * (width - leftMargin - rightMargin) / (maxX - minX)\n            imgY = topMargin + (nodeLayout.y) * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1)   // because the leaves are at indices 0..n-1\n\n   Then we draw:\n\n        We traverse the tree and for each internal node:\n\n            // Draw horizontal line from left child to (node.x, left child.y) and then vertical to (node.x, node.y)\n            // Similarly for the right child.\n\n        We can do a recursive drawing.\n\n   We\'ll create a method:\n\n        private void drawNode(Graphics2D g2, NodeLayout layout, double minX, double maxX, int n, \n                             int leftMargin, int topMargin, int width, int height) {\n\n            if (layout.left != null) {\n                drawNode(g2, layout.left, minX, maxX, n, leftMargin, topMargin, width, height);\n                // Draw line from left child to current node\n                double x1 = leftMargin + (layout.left.x - minX) * (width - leftMargin - rightMargin) / (maxX - minX);\n                double y1 = topMargin + layout.left.y * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1);\n                double x2 = leftMargin + (layout.x - minX) * (width - leftMargin - rightMargin) / (maxX - minX);\n                double y2 = topMargin + layout.left.y * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1);\n                double y3 = topMargin + layout.y * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1);\n                g2.drawLine((int)x1, (int)y1, (int)x2, (int)y2);   // horizontal line for left child\n                g2.drawLine((int)x2, (int)y2, (int)x2, (int)y3);   // vertical line to the node\'s y\n            }\n            if (layout.right != null) {\n                drawNode(g2, layout.right, minX, maxX, n, leftMargin, topMargin, width, height);\n                // Similarly for right child\n                double x1 = leftMargin + (layout.right.x - minX) * (width - leftMargin - rightMargin) / (maxX - minX);\n                double y1 = topMargin + layout.right.y * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1);\n                double x2 = leftMargin + (layout.x - minX) * (width - leftMargin - rightMargin) / (maxX - minX);\n                double y2 = topMargin + layout.right.y * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1);\n                double y3 = topMargin + layout.y * (height - topMargin - bottomMargin) / (n-1);\n                g2.drawLine((int)x1, (int)y1, (int)x2, (int)y2);\n                g2.drawLine((int)x2, (int)y2, (int)x2, (int)y3);\n            }\n        }\n\n   But note: the vertical line from the two children to the node should be the same vertical line?

## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to implement the clustering by threshold. Given a phylogenetic tree (built in the previous task) and a list of threshold values (from thresholds.txt), we need to determine the clusters of species that are still connected when we "cut" the tree at each threshold.\n\n Important points:\n - The tree was built with internal nodes having a "height" which is the similarity score (Needleman-Wunsch score) at which the merge happened.\n - A threshold is a similarity score (integer). We traverse the tree and consider that a node (and the entire subtree below it) forms a cluster if the node\'s height is above the threshold and its parent\'s height is below the threshold (or it is the root). However, note that in our tree, the root has the highest similarity (because we merged the most similar last) and leaves have 0.\n\n But note: the tree is built bottom-up, so the root has the highest similarity (most recent common ancestor) and leaves have 0 (extant species). The internal nodes have decreasing similarity as we go down? Actually, the height of the internal node is the similarity at which the merge happened. So when we cut at a threshold, we want to ignore any merges that happened below (i.e., with similarity less than) the threshold.\n\n However, in our tree, the merges that happened at a high similarity (close to the root) are the ones that are more recent. So to form clusters for a threshold T, we want to break the tree at every edge where the parent node\'s similarity is above T and the child node\'s similarity is below T? Actually, we can think of the tree as having branch lengths that are the difference in similarity between the node and its parent.\n\n But the requirement is: "we check which leaf nodes still end up connected". So two leaves are in the same cluster if the path connecting them in the tree does not have any edge that is broken by the threshold. And we break an edge when the similarity (height) of the node is below the threshold? Actually, we break the tree at the threshold: we remove every edge that has a branch length that would place the node below the threshold? \n\n Alternatively, we can traverse the tree and form clusters by collecting all leaves that are connected without going below the threshold.\n\n Steps for one threshold:\n   - Start at the root. If the root\'s height is above the threshold, then we can consider the entire tree as one cluster? But wait, the root\'s height is the maximum similarity. However, the root\'s children might be below the threshold? \n\n Actually, we can do a post-order traversal and form clusters by:\n   - If the node is a leaf, then it forms a cluster of one.\n   - If the node is an internal node:\n        - If the node\'s height is above the threshold, then we merge the clusters from the left and right subtrees (because the merge happened above the threshold, so they are connected at this threshold).\n        - If the node\'s height is below the threshold, then we do not merge the clusters from the left and right. Instead, we return the clusters from the left and the clusters from the right as separate.\n\n However, note: the tree is built so that the root has the highest similarity and the leaves have 0. So if the threshold is 1000, then any internal node with height >=1000 will form a cluster that includes all the leaves in its subtree. But if the node\'s height is below 1000, then the leaves in its left and right subtrees are not connected at that threshold.\n\n Therefore, algorithm for one threshold T:\n   - Traverse the tree (post-order):\n        - If node is leaf: return a cluster containing just that leaf.\n        - If node is internal:\n             leftClusters = traverse(leftChild)\n             rightClusters = traverse(rightChild)\n             if (node.height >= T) {\n                 // This node is above the threshold, so we merge the clusters from left and right\n                 return { merge(leftClusters and rightClusters into one cluster) }\n             } else {\n                 // This node is below the threshold, so we don\'t merge\n                 return leftClusters + rightClusters   (as separate clusters)\n             }\n\n But note: the entire tree might break into more than two clusters? Actually, if an internal node is below the threshold, then we break the connection at that node, so the left subtree and the right subtree become separate clusters. However, each subtree might break into multiple clusters? So we are returning a list of clusters at each node.\n\n We can represent a cluster as a set of species names (the leaf names).\n\n However, note: the internal node might have a height below the threshold, but what about its children? They might be above or below? Actually, the children of an internal node are either leaves or internal nodes that were formed at a higher similarity (so they have a higher height). Therefore, when we break at a node, we are only breaking the connection between the left and right subtrees. The subtrees themselves might have broken into multiple clusters already.\n\n So the algorithm:\n\n   function findClusters(node, threshold) returns List<Set<String>>:\n        if node is leaf:\n            return [ {node.name} ]\n\n        leftClusters = findClusters(node.left, threshold)\n        rightClusters = findClusters(node.right, threshold)\n\n        if node.height >= threshold:\n            // Merge all clusters from left and right into one cluster\n            Set<String> merged = new HashSet<>();\n            merged.addAll(flatten(leftClusters));\n            merged.addAll(flatten(rightClusters));\n            return [ merged ]\n        else:\n            // Return the clusters from left and right without merging\n            List<Set<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();\n            result.addAll(leftClusters);\n            result.addAll(rightClusters);\n            return result\n\n However, note: the above merging is too eager. We are merging all clusters from the left and right subtrees at this node. But what if the left subtree already broke into multiple clusters? Then we are merging them all together? That is not correct.\n\n Actually, when the node is above the threshold, we want to form one cluster that is the entire subtree of this node. But that is exactly the set of leaves in this subtree. So we can simply collect all the leaves in the subtree? \n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the recursion and just collect the leaves. But we want to do it recursively.\n\n We can change: instead of returning a list of clusters at each node, we can return the set of leaves in the entire subtree? But then we lose the information of the clusters that are already broken? \n\n Actually, when the node is above the threshold, we are forming one cluster that is the entire subtree. When the node is below the threshold, we are returning the clusters from the left and right without merging.\n\n But note: if the node is above the threshold, then the entire subtree is one cluster. So we can return a list containing one set: the set of all leaves in the subtree.\n\n How to get all leaves? We could traverse the subtree, but that would be inefficient. Instead, we can precompute the set of leaves for each node? Or we can compute it during the recursion.\n\n We can modify the algorithm to return two things: \n   - the set of leaves in the subtree (for when we need to merge at an above-threshold node)\n   - the list of clusters in the subtree (for when we break)\n\n But we can do without storing the entire set of leaves at every node? We are only going to use the set of leaves when we merge at a node above the threshold. So we can compute the set of leaves for a node by combining the sets from the left and right. We can do:\n\n   function findClusters(node, threshold) returns (setOfLeaves, listOfClusters)\n\n   For a leaf: \n        setOfLeaves = { node.name }\n        listOfClusters = [ {node.name} ]\n\n   For an internal node:\n        (leftLeaves, leftClusters) = findClusters(left)\n        (rightLeaves, rightClusters) = findClusters(right)\n        setOfLeaves = leftLeaves ‚à™ rightLeaves\n\n        if node.height >= threshold:\n            // We form one cluster for the entire subtree\n            listOfClusters = [ setOfLeaves ]\n        else:\n            // We break: so the clusters are the ones from left and right\n            listOfClusters = new ArrayList<>(leftClusters)\n            listOfClusters.addAll(rightClusters)\n\n        return (setOfLeaves, listOfClusters)\n\n However, note: when we break, we are returning the clusters from the children. But the children might have broken into multiple clusters. So that is correct.\n\n But the problem: we don\'t need the set of leaves for anything except to form the merged cluster. And we can compute the set of leaves by taking the union of the clusters? But the clusters in the children might be broken? Actually, in the children we have the set of leaves for the entire subtree of the child. So we can compute the set of leaves for the current node by leftLeaves ‚à™ rightLeaves.\n\n However, we are already returning the set of leaves. So we can do.\n\n But we are only using the set of leaves when we merge. So we can avoid returning the set of leaves by having each node know its leaves? We could precompute and store the set of leaves in each node during tree construction. Let\'s modify the PhyloNode class to include a set of leaves (or just the count? but we need the names). Since we are building the tree, we can store the set of leaf names in each node.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute it on the fly for the entire tree once and store it in the node. But the tree is static. So we can do:\n\n   We\'ll add a field in PhyloNode: private Set<String> leafNames;\n\n   For a leaf node: leafNames = Collections.singleton(name)\n   For an internal node: leafNames = union of leafNames of left and right.\n\n Then we don\'t have to compute it recursively during the clustering.\n\n Then the algorithm for one threshold becomes:\n\n   function findClusters(node, threshold) returns List<Set<String>>:\n        if node is leaf:\n            return [ {node.name} ]\n\n        leftClusters = findClusters(node.left, threshold)\n        rightClusters = findClusters(node.right, threshold)\n\n        if node.height >= threshold:\n            // We form one cluster: the entire set of leaves in this subtree\n            return [ node.leafNames ]\n        else:\n            return leftClusters + rightClusters\n\n But note: what if one of the children is above the threshold? Then the leftClusters might be a list of one cluster (the entire left subtree) and the rightClusters might be a list of one cluster (the entire right subtree). Then we return two clusters. That is correct.\n\n However, we must precompute the leafNames for every node. We can do this during tree construction.\n\n Let\'s update the PhyloNode class to include leafNames.\n\n We\'ll create the leafNames in the constructor:\n\n   For leaf: \n        this.leafNames = Set.of(name);\n\n   For internal node:\n        this.leafNames = new HashSet<>(left.getLeafNames());\n        this.leafNames.addAll(right.getLeafNames());\n\n And we add a getter: getLeafNames()\n\n Then the clustering algorithm becomes:\n\n   public List<Set<String>> findClusters(PhyloNode node, int threshold) {\n        if (node.isLeaf()) {\n            Set<String> cluster = new HashSet<>();\n            cluster.add(node.getName());\n            return Collections.singletonList(cluster);\n        }\n\n        List<Set<String>> leftClusters = findClusters(node.getLeft(), threshold);\n        List<Set<String>> rightClusters = findClusters(node.getRight(), threshold);\n\n        if (node.getHeight() >= threshold) {\n            // Merge the entire subtree into one cluster\n            Set<String> cluster = new HashSet<>(node.getLeafNames());\n            return Collections.singletonList(cluster);\n        } else {\n            // Combine the clusters from left and right without merging\n            List<Set<String>> clusters = new ArrayList<>();\n            clusters.addAll(leftClusters);\n            clusters.addAll(rightClusters);\n            return clusters;\n        }\n   }\n\n But note: the root node is the entire tree. We start at the root. The root\'s height is the highest. So if the threshold is less than the root\'s height, we form one cluster? That is correct.\n\n However, what if the threshold is above the root\'s height? Then we break at the root? But the root is the highest node. Then we would break the root and return the clusters from left and right. But that is correct: the tree breaks into two clusters.\n\n But note: the root node\'s height is the similarity at which the last two clusters were merged. So if the threshold is above that, then the two clusters were never merged. So they are separate.\n\n Therefore, the algorithm is sound.\n\n We\'ll implement:\n\n   Precompute leafNames for every node during tree construction (we can do this in the Cluster class when building the tree).\n\n Then, for each threshold in the thresholds.txt file, we run the clustering and save the results.\n\n Output format: we need to save the clusters for each threshold. We can write to a file "clusters_blosumXX.json", where XX is the BLOSUM version. The structure could be:\n\n   {\n     "threshold1": [ [cluster1_species], [cluster2_species], ... ],\n     "threshold2": [ ... ],\n     ...\n   }\n\n But note: the clusters are sets of species names. We can represent the clusters as lists (order doesn\'t matter) of species names.\n\n Alternatively, we can write:\n\n   {\n     "threshold1": {\n         "cluster1": ["species1", "species2", ...],\n         "cluster2": [ ... ]\n     },\n     ...\n   }\n\n But the problem: the clusters are not labeled. So we can use a list of clusters.\n\n So:\n\n   Map<Integer, List<List<String>>> result\n\n   Where the key is the threshold (integer) and the value is a list of clusters, and each cluster is a list of species names.\n\n We can write this as a JSON object with integer keys? Actually, JSON keys are strings. So we can do:\n\n   {\n     "1260": [ ["Horse", "Donkey"], ["Wild boar", "Pig"] ],\n     ...\n   }\n\n But we can also use an array of objects with threshold and clusters.\n\n However, the requirement is to have the clusters for each threshold. We\'ll use a JSON object where the keys are the string representation of the threshold.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Read thresholds from thresholds.txt (one integer per line)\n   For each threshold:\n        clusters = findClusters(root, threshold)\n        Convert clusters: each cluster is a set -> convert to list (and sort? for consistency) or leave as set? But output should be consistent.\n\n   We can sort the species names in each cluster and also sort the clusters by the first species? Or just output arbitrarily? \n\n   We\'ll output the clusters as a list of lists of species.\n\n   Then write the entire map to a JSON file.\n\n We\'ll use Jackson for JSON serialization.\n\n Steps in code:\n\n   - Precompute leafNames for every node (done during tree building in Cluster)\n   - Read thresholds from thresholds.txt\n   - For each threshold, compute clusters (using recursive method above)\n   - Write the results to a JSON file.\n\n Let\'s update the PhyloNode class to include leafNames.\n\n We\'ll also need to update the Cluster class to set the leafNames when building the node.\n\n In Cluster constructor for a leaf:\n        node = new PhyloNode(organism)   -> this node will have leafNames = Set.of(organism)\n\n In Cluster constructor for an internal node (merging two clusters):\n        node = new PhyloNode(similarity, left.getNode(), right.getNode()) \n        and then we set the leafNames of that node as the union of left and right leafNames.\n\n So we need to update the PhyloNode constructors to take the leafNames? Or we can compute it in the PhyloNode constructor.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the leafNames in the Cluster and pass it to the PhyloNode.\n\n We\'ll modify PhyloNode:\n\n   public PhyloNode(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.height = 0.0;\n        this.left = null;\n        this.right = null;\n        this.leafNames = Set.of(name);\n   }\n\n   public PhyloNode(double height, PhyloNode left, PhyloNode right) {\n        this.name = null;\n        this.height = height;\n        this.left = left;\n        this.right = right;\n        this.leafNames = new HashSet<>(left.leafNames);\n        this.leafNames.addAll(right.leafNames);\n   }\n\n   And add a getter: getLeafNames()\n\n Now, we are ready to implement the clustering.\n\n We\'ll create a class `ClusterFinder`:\n\n   package com.example.project;\n\n   import java.util.*;\n\n   public class ClusterFinder {\n        public static Map<Integer, List<Set<String>>> findClustersForThresholds(\n            PhyloNode root, List<Integer> thresholds) {\n\n            Map<Integer, List<Set<String>>> result = new HashMap<>();\n            for (int threshold : thresholds) {\n                List<Set<String>> clusters = findClusters(root, threshold);\n                result.put(threshold, clusters);\n            }\n            return result;\n        }\n\n        private static List<Set<String>> findClusters(PhyloNode node, int threshold) {\n            if (node.isLeaf()) {\n                Set<String> cluster = new HashSet<>();\n                cluster.add(node.getName());\n                return Collections.singletonList(cluster);\n            }\n\n            List<Set<String>> leftClusters = findClusters(node.getLeft(), threshold);\n            List<Set<String>> rightClusters = findClusters(node.getRight(), threshold);\n\n            if (node.getHeight() >= threshold) {\n                // Merge into one cluster: the entire set of leaves under this node\n                return Collections.singletonList(new HashSet<>(node.getLeafNames()));\n            } else {\n                List<Set<String>> clusters = new ArrayList<>();\n                clusters.addAll(leftClusters);\n                clusters.addAll(rightClusters);\n                return clusters;\n            }\n        }\n   }\n\n Then in the main, we read the thresholds from a file, call `ClusterFinder.findClustersForThresholds` and write the result to a JSON file.\n\n We\'ll write the JSON with Jackson.\n\n Note: We are using sets for clusters. When we write to JSON, we can write as arrays. The set order is arbitrary, but we can sort the arrays for consistency.\n\n We\'ll sort the species names in each cluster and then sort the clusters by the smallest species name? Or just output arbitrarily? \n\n We can do:\n\n   For each threshold, for each cluster: sort the list of species names.\n\n   Then sort the list of clusters by the first element? Or by the smallest element? Or by the size? The problem does not specify.\n\n   We\'ll sort each cluster alphabetically and then sort the list of clusters by the first element of the cluster.\n\n   But note: the problem does not require a particular order. We can output arbitrarily.\n\n   However, for testing and readability, we can sort.\n\n   So:\n\n      for (List<Set<String>> clusters : result.values()) {\n          List<List<String>> sortedClusters = new ArrayList<>();\n          for ('} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 7941, 'total_tokens': 12037, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 7680}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 7680, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 261}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '7b32154c-67b6-488a-8b0e-26d97088445d', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--28d0d47c-aea0-4ab5-afe8-174c13f9f823-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7941, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 12037, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 7680}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

### Solution Overview
We'll implement threshold-based clustering using the phylogenetic tree structure. For each threshold:
1. Traverse the tree to find clusters of species that remain connected above the threshold
2. Store clusters as lists of species names
3. Output results to console and save to JSON with threshold-based keys

## Prompt 13

**User:** Goal: Checking if provided solution covers all previously mentioned requirements.
Instruction: This was the end of coding tasks for this project. Right now all functionalities should be covered. The final code should start with reading input ‚ÄúblosumXX.json‚Äù and ‚Äúorganism.json‚Äù files and at the end print clusters for thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file to the standard output. Additionally, saving intermediate outputs as previously mentioned. This will be considered as a successful implementation. Now it is time to check if this implementation covers all requirements. Remember that implemented solutions must be of high quality. 
Expected Output: List of all previously provided requirements with short note on whether or not it is covered in the generated code.

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to review the entire project requirements and check if they are covered by the generated code.\n\n The project was divided into several tasks:\n\n Task 1: Needleman-Wunsch Similarity Calculation\n   - Read organisms from organisms.json (Map<String, String>)\n   - Read BLOSUM matrix from blosumXX.json (Map<String, Integer>)\n   - For every pair of species, compute the Needleman-Wunsch score using the BLOSUM matrix for substitution and gap penalties.\n   - Save the scores in a structure for fast access (SimilarityMatrix) and also to a JSON file (organisms_scores_blosumXX.json) with keys as species pairs (concatenated with "_") and integer values.\n\n Task 2: Phylogenetic Tree Construction\n   - Build a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering (agglomerative, single linkage) based on the similarity scores (higher is better).\n   - The tree is built by merging the two most similar clusters at each step, creating internal nodes with the similarity score as the node\'s height.\n   - The tree is then saved in two Newick formats:\n        a. Without branch lengths: tree_blosumXX_newick.nw\n        b. With branch lengths (as integers): tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw\n   - Additionally, draw a dendrogram and save it as phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png (horizontally, with x-axis as the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores).\n\n Task 3: Threshold-Based Clustering\n   - Read thresholds from thresholds.txt (one integer per line).\n   - For each threshold, traverse the tree to form clusters of species that are connected at or above the threshold.\n   - The clusters are lists of species names (each cluster is a list, and the result is a list of clusters).\n   - Print the clusters to the console and also save them to a JSON file (clusters_for_blosumXX.json) where the key is the threshold and the value is the list of clusters.\n\n Now, let\'s check each requirement:\n\n 1. Needleman-Wunsch Implementation:\n    - Covered by: BlosumMatrix, NeedlemanWunsch, SimilarityMatrix, and Main (for reading files and computing pairwise scores).\n    - The scores are saved to organisms_scores_blosumXX.json.\n\n 2. Tree Building:\n    - Covered by: PhyloNode, Cluster, PhyloTreeBuilder.\n    - The tree is built using single linkage with the highest similarity.\n\n 3. Newick Format Saving:\n    - Covered by: NewickSerializer, which saves two versions.\n\n 4. Dendrogram Drawing:\n    - Not implemented in the provided code. The requirement was to draw a dendrogram and save as a PNG file. We did not generate code for this.\n\n 5. Threshold Clustering:\n    - Covered by: ClusterFinder and the updated Main class that reads thresholds and computes clusters.\n\n 6. Output of Clusters:\n    - The clusters are printed to the console and saved to a JSON file.\n\n 7. Code Quality:\n    - The code is structured in packages, follows OOP principles, uses Java 21, and includes error handling and documentation.\n\n Missing Component:\n    - The dendrogram drawing (Task 2) was not implemented.\n\n Additional Notes:\n    - The dendrogram drawing requirement was specified in the second task and then again in a later instruction. We have not provided any code for it.\n\n Therefore, we must add the dendrogram drawing.\n\n Since the requirement is to use Java and we are already using Maven, we can choose a library for drawing. However, the requirement was to have the dendrogram horizontally and use the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances (which are the heights in the tree) for the x-axis.\n\n We can use the JavaFX or Swing for drawing, but note that the project should be production-ready and we want to avoid heavy dependencies. Alternatively, we can use an external library for charting. However, the instruction says: "You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want".\n\n Given the complexity of drawing a dendrogram, we can use the JFreeChart library, which is a popular charting library. We will add it as a Maven dependency.\n\n Steps to add dendrogram drawing:\n\n 1. Add JFreeChart dependency to pom.xml.\n 2. Create a class DendrogramDrawer that takes the PhyloNode and draws the dendrogram.\n 3. Save the chart as a PNG file.\n\n However, note that the requirement was for the dendrogram to be horizontal. JFreeChart has a CategoryPlot that can be used for horizontal bar charts, but for a dendrogram we might need a specialized renderer.\n\n Alternatively, we can write a custom Swing component to draw the dendrogram. But that might be complex.\n\n Given the time, and since the requirement is to have a visual representation, we can use a recursive method to draw the dendrogram using Java2D and save as PNG.\n\n But note: The requirement was to have the x-coordinates determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (which are the heights in the tree). So the branch lengths in the dendrogram are the differences in heights (as in the Newick with distances).\n\n However, the instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". This implies that the horizontal axis should represent the similarity score (the height of the node).\n\n Therefore, we can draw the dendrogram with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom, and the horizontal position of each node being its height (similarity score). But the requirement says horizontally laid out, meaning the leaves are on the left and the root is on the right? Or the branches are horizontal?\n\n Actually, a horizontal dendrogram typically has the root on the left and the leaves on the right, and the branches extend horizontally. The length of the horizontal branch is the distance (or in our case, the similarity score).\n\n However, note: in our tree, the leaves have height 0 and the root has the highest similarity score. But the branch lengths (as in the Newick with distances) are calculated as the difference between the parent\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\n But the requirement says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". This might be interpreted as the absolute similarity score of the node (not the branch length). So the position of a node would be at x = node.getHeight().\n\n How about:\n\n   - The root node is at x = root.getHeight(), y = ... (we arrange leaves vertically).\n   - Then the children are at x = child.getHeight(), and then we draw horizontal lines from the child to the parent at the parent\'s height.\n\n This would be a traditional dendrogram.\n\n However, note that the requirement says "horizontally". We might need to rotate the dendrogram so that the root is at the right and the leaves are at the left, and the branches extend horizontally to the right.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   - We traverse the tree to assign coordinates to each node.\n   - The x coordinate of a node is its height (the similarity score at which it was created).\n   - The y coordinate of a leaf is assigned in order (evenly spaced vertically).\n   - For an internal node, its y coordinate is the midpoint of its two children.\n\n Then we draw:\n   - For an internal node, draw a horizontal line from (child1.x, child1.y) to (node.x, child1.y) and then a vertical line from (node.x, child1.y) to (node.x, child2.y) and then a horizontal line to (child2.x, child2.y)? \n   - Actually, we draw:\n        - From child1: (child1.x, child1.y) to (node.x, child1.y) [horizontal]\n        - From child2: (child2.x, child2.y) to (node.x, child2.y) [horizontal]\n        - Then a vertical line from (node.x, child1.y) to (node.x, child2.y)\n        - Then from the internal node, we would draw to its parent? But we are drawing from the bottom up.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a recursive method to draw the tree.\n\n But note: the requirement is for a horizontal layout. So the root will be at the rightmost and the leaves at the left.\n\n Steps:\n\n  1. Assign coordinates:\n        - Leaves: x = 0 (because their height is 0) and y = ... (in order, from top to bottom)\n        - Internal nodes: x = node.getHeight() (the similarity score at which the node was created)\n        - The y of an internal node is the midpoint of its two children.\n\n  2. Then we draw:\n        - For each node, we draw a horizontal line from the child\'s x to the node\'s x at the child\'s y level.\n        - Then a vertical line from (node.x, child1.y) to (node.x, child2.y) to connect the two children.\n\n  3. We can use a BufferedImage and Graphics2D to draw.\n\n However, the height of the image must be proportional to the number of leaves, and the width must be from 0 to the maximum height (root height).\n\n We\'ll create a class DendrogramDrawer:\n\n    public class DendrogramDrawer {\n        public static void drawDendrogram(PhyloNode root, String filename, int width, int height) {\n            // First, assign y coordinates to leaves and compute the layout\n            // Then, draw the tree\n        }\n\n        private static void assignCoordinates(PhyloNode node, ...) {\n            // ... \n        }\n\n        private static void drawNode(PhyloNode node, Graphics2D g2, ...) {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n\n But note: the requirement says the x coordinates are the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances (the node heights). So the root node will be at x = root.getHeight(), and the leaves at x=0.\n\n However, the root.getHeight() might be very large and the number of leaves might be very many. We need to scale the x and y for drawing.\n\n We can scale the x from 0 to maxHeight (root height) to fit the image width, and the y from 0 to image height.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that we are at the end of the project, and the requirement for production-ready code, we must note that the dendrogram drawing is non-trivial.\n\n Since the requirement for the dendrogram was mentioned in the second task and we have not implemented it, we must add it.\n\n However, due to the complexity and the scope of this response, we will outline the steps but not generate the entire code? But the instruction says to generate the code.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a simple text-based dendrogram? But the requirement is a PNG.\n\n Given the time constraints, I will provide a simplified version using Java2D, but note that it might not be perfect for all cases.\n\n Steps for DendrogramDrawer:\n\n   1. Traverse the tree to collect leaves and assign them a y-coordinate (evenly spaced).\n   2. Do a recursive pass to assign coordinates to internal nodes (x = node.getHeight(), y = midpoint of children).\n   3. Scale the coordinates to fit the image.\n   4. Draw the tree.\n\n Let\'s create the DendrogramDrawer class.\n\n But note: the project is already complex and we are only required to generate the code for the dendrogram now.\n\n We\'ll create:\n\n   - DendrogramDrawer.java\n\n And update Main to call it.\n\n However, the requirement was to save as "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png".\n\n Given the complexity, I will generate the code for DendrogramDrawer, but note that it is a non-trivial task and might require debugging.\n\n We assume that the tree is binary.\n\n Code for DendrogramDrawer:\n\n   We\'ll use a recursive method to assign coordinates and then to draw.\n\n   We need to know the number of leaves to set the image height.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     1. First, we do a pass to assign initial coordinates (without scaling) in a space where:\n          - x: from 0 to maxX (which is the root height)\n          - y: leaves from 0 to (n-1) * leafSpacing (so that the total height is (n-1)*leafSpacing)\n\n     2. Then we scale to fit the image.\n\n     3. We draw the tree by traversing the nodes.\n\n   We\'ll create a helper class NodeInfo to store the coordinates and the node.\n\n   However, to keep it simple, we\'ll do:\n\n        assignCoordinates(PhyloNode node, double minY, double maxY, Map<PhyloNode, Point2D> coordinates, double maxHeight)\n\n   But note: the x of a node is its height, and we want the leaves to be at x=0? Actually, no: the leaves are at height 0, so x=0. The root is at x = root.getHeight().\n\n   The drawing will be from the leaves to the root.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        For a leaf: \n            x = 0 (because height=0)\n            y = assigned y (from 0 to totalHeight)\n\n        For an internal node:\n            x = node.getHeight()\n            y = (child1.y + child2.y) / 2\n\n        Then we draw:\n            - From child1: (child1.x, child1.y) to (node.x, child1.y) [horizontal line]\n            - From child2: (child2.x, child2.y) to (node.x, child2.y) [horizontal line]\n            - Then a vertical line from (node.x, child1.y) to (node.x, child2.y)\n\n   But note: the requirement is horizontal layout. This is horizontal in the sense that the branches are horizontal? Yes.\n\n   Then we can draw the lines accordingly.\n\n   However, we must scale the coordinates to the image.\n\n   Let\'s write the DendrogramDrawer.\n\n But note: the root node might have multiple children? No, because we are building a binary tree.\n\n   So the tree is strictly binary.\n\n   We\'ll create:\n\n        DendrogramDrawer.java\n\n   And then call it in Main.\n\n Given the complexity and the fact that the entire code for drawing might be long, I will generate a simplified version.\n\n We are going to:\n\n   - Compute the layout (coordinates) recursively.\n   - Then draw on a BufferedImage.\n\n We\'ll use:\n\n   - A constant for the image width and height. We can set the image width to be (int) (maxX * xScale) and height to (numberOfLeaves * leafSpacing) but we need to set leafSpacing.\n\n   - Alternatively, we can set a fixed image size and then scale the coordinates.\n\n   We\'ll set the image width to 800 and the height to 600, and then scale the x from 0 to maxX to 0 to 800, and the y from 0 to totalHeight (which is the maximum y assigned) to 0 to 600.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        int width = 800;\n        int height = 600;\n\n        // Find the maximum height (root.getHeight())\n        double maxHeight = root.getHeight();\n\n        // The total y range is from 0 to (numberOfLeaves-1)*leafSpacing, but we don\'t know leafSpacing? We can assign leafSpacing = 50, then totalY = (numberOfLeaves-1)*50.\n\n        // But we want to fit the image, so we can do:\n        //   We know the number of leaves, so we can set the leafSpacing = height / (numberOfLeaves - 1) but then we have to assign the y coordinates accordingly.\n\n        // Alternatively, we can assign the y coordinates in a normalized space [0,1] and then scale to image.\n\n   We\'ll do:\n\n        Step 1: Count leaves and assign an index to each leaf (from 0 to n-1).\n        Step 2: The y coordinate of a leaf is set to (index * (imageHeight-1) / (n-1)) [if n>1, else 0]. But we are working in a normalized layout first.\n\n   Actually, we can assign:\n\n        y = index * (1.0)   // in a normalized space where the leaves are at 0, 1, 2, ... n-1\n\n        Then we scale to image by: y_image = (int) (y * (imageHeight-1) / (n-1))\n\n   But for internal nodes, we take the midpoint.\n\n   We\'ll do a recursive function to assign the y coordinates and collect the leaves.\n\n   Then we draw the lines.\n\n   We\'ll create a helper class to store the coordinates for each node.\n\n   Due to the complexity, we will generate the code for DendrogramDrawer.\n\n   Note: This is a non-trivial task and might be buggy. We assume the tree is not null and has at least one leaf.\n\n   We\'ll create:\n\n        DendrogramDrawer.java\n\n   And then update Main to use it.\n\n   However, the requirement is for production-ready code. We will include error handling and scaling.\n\n   Given the time, I will provide a basic implementation.\n\n   Steps for DendrogramDrawer:\n\n        public class DendrogramDrawer {\n            public static void draw(PhyloNode root, String filename, int width, int height) throws IOException {\n                // Step 1: Count leaves and assign leaf indices\n                List<PhyloNode> leaves = new ArrayList<>();\n                collectLeaves(root, leaves);\n                int n = leaves.size();\n\n                // Map to store coordinates for each node\n                Map<PhyloNode, Point2D.Double> coordinates = new HashMap<>();\n\n                // Assign initial coordinates to leaves: x=0, y=index\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                    coordinates.put(leaves.get(i), new Point2D.Double(0, i));\n                }\n\n                // Assign coordinates to internal nodes (post-order traversal)\n                assignCoordinates(root, coordinates);\n\n                // Now, we have raw coordinates. We need to scale them to fit the image.\n                // Find min and max x and y in the coordinates\n                double minX = Double.MAX_VALUE, maxX = Double.MIN_VALUE;\n                double minY = Double.MAX_VALUE, maxY = Double.MIN_VALUE;\n                for (Point2D.Double point : coordinates.values()) {\n                    if (point.x < minX) minX = point.x;\n                    if (point.x > maxX) maxX = point.x;\n                    if (point.y < minY) minY = point.y;\n                    if (point.y > maxY) maxY = point.y;\n                }\n\n                // If there\'s only one leaf, we adjust\n                if (n == 1) {\n                    minY = 0;\n                    maxY = 1;\n                }\n\n                // Create image\n                BufferedImage image = new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB);\n                Graphics2D g2 = image.createGraphics();\n                g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);\n                g2.setColor(Color.WHITE);\n                g2.fillRect(0, 0'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 9033, 'total_tokens': 13129, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 8064}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 8064, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 969}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'f68a908a-a853-4028-93f6-91cd25b63bd2', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--234239fd-5b71-4058-8173-c2ab79ad15d8-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9033, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 13129, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 8064}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
