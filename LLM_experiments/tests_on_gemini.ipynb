      "\n",
      "Executing prompt Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. \n",
      "Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. \n",
      "My input consists of DNA sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. \n",

      "Instruction: I need this program to be written in Java 21, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using Maven 3.9 to build a project. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow PEP formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.\n",

      "\n",
      "Executing prompt Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. \n",
      "Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it for a similar purpose, aligning DNA sequences.\n",
      "We have two input files. The first one is named \"organisms.json\" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its DNA string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the \"organism.json\" file: ``` {\"Wild boar\": \"MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL\", \"Horse\": \"MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT\"} ``` .\n",
      "The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where \"XX\" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba\": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.\n",
      "In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two DNA sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.\n",

      "Executing prompt Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.\n",
      "Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their DNAs strings, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. \n",
      "Exemplary test case for the created code: having one DNA string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another DNA string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {\"a\":-1, \"b\":-2, \"ab\":-3, \"ba\":-3, \"aa\":2, \"bb\":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.\n",

Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. \n",
      "As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different \"blosumXX.json\" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called \"organisms_scores_bloumXX.json\". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. \n",

      "\n",
      "Executing prompt Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. \n",
      "Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a \"tree of file\" from the bottom up. \n",
      "In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.\n",
      "This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most python libraries operates on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. \n",
      "For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in \"organisms_scores_blosumXX.json\" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in \"thresholds.txt\" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. \n",
      "Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.\n",

      "\n",
      "Executing prompt Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.\n",
      "Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. \n",
      "It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). \n",
      "During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species \"Horse\" and \"Dog\" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. \n",

      "second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: \"(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);\" - this should be saved to a \"tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw\", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).\n",

      "There is an additional input file called \"thresholds.txt\", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. \n",
      "Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. \n",
      "As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. \n",
