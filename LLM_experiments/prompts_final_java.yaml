  - name: Session set up
    text: |
      Goal: Setting up the role LLM should take for this conversation. 
      Instruction:  I need to implement a new project from the beginning to end and I will need your help. Through this session, you should act as a senior java developer. I will divide my inputs into descriptions of the task, and requests for code generation. You should always carefully analyze the requirements and constrains. When generating code, make sure it is clean and efficient.
      Expected Output: Confirmation of specified role. Apply it to every further part of the conversation.

  - name: Project introduction
    text: |
      Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
      Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
      My input consists of DNA sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
      Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  

  - name: Technical requirements
    text: |
      Goal: Setting up technical requirements for all code solutions generated through the conversation. 
      Instruction: I need this program to be written in Java 21, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using Maven 3.9 to build a project. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow Google Java Style Guide formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.
      Expected Output: Confirmation of specified requirement. Apply it to every code generated in further parts of conversation, but do not generate any code for this answer.

   - name: Needleman-Wunsch algorithm - explanation
    text: |
      Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
      Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it for a similar purpose, aligning DNA sequences.
      We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its DNA string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
      The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
      In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two DNA sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
      Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

  - name: Needleman-Wunsch algorithm - implementation
    text: |
      Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
      Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their DNAs strings, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
      Exemplary test case for the created code: having one DNA string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another DNA string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
      Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
      Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

  - name: Needleman-Wunsch algorithm - save results
    text: |
      Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
      Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
      As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
      Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

  - name: Phylogenetic Tree - explanation
    text: |
      Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
      Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
      In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
      This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
      For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
      Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
      Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

  - name: Phylogenetic Tree - build implementation
    text: |
      Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
      Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
      It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
      During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
      The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
      Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

  - name: Phylogenetic Tree - Newick generation
    text: |
      Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
      Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
      first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
      second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
      Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

  - name: Phylogenetic Tree - dendrogram generation
    text: |
      Goal: Generating a code for drawing a dendrogram of created tree.
      Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
      You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
      Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

  - name: Clustering - explanation 
    text: |
      Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
      Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
      There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
      Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
      As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
      Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

  - name: Clustering - implementation
    text: |
      Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
      Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
      Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
      Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

  - name: Poject summary
    text: |
      Goal: Checking if provided solution covers all previously mentioned requirements.
      Instruction: This was the end of coding tasks for this project. Right now all functionalities should be covered. The final code should start with reading input “blosumXX.json” and “organism.json” files and at the end print clusters for thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file to the standard output. Additionally, saving intermediate outputs as previously mentioned. This will be considered as a successful implementation. Now it is time to check if this implementation covers all requirements. Remember that implemented solutions must be of high quality. 
      Expected Output: List of all previously provided requirements with short note on whether or not it is covered in the generated code.

Generate an outline of what files I should have in the repository, including requirements.txt and any other file necessary to set up and start the program. For each file provide a final code that should be in this file and a short description of what this file contains. 
      Expected Output: List of all files that should be included in the final code set up, with description of what given files contains and final version of code to put it this file.
