## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  


**LLM Response:**

## Project Summary

You need to build a phylogenetic clustering system for amino acid sequences across different species. The project involves:

1. **Input**: Amino acid sequences from multiple species
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a predefined substitution scoring matrix
3. **Tree Construction**: Building a phylogenetic tree from the pairwise similarity scores
4. **Visualization**: Creating a dendrogram representation
5. **Clustering**: Implementing threshold-based clustering to group species

## Key Project Aspects

### 1. **Sequence Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch)**
- Global alignment algorithm for comparing amino acid sequences
- Requires substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM, PAM)
- Produces similarity/distance scores for all sequence pairs
- Time complexity: O(mn) per pair

### 2. **Distance Matrix Construction**
- Convert alignment scores to distance measures
- Create symmetric matrix for all species pairs
- Critical for hierarchical clustering

### 3. **Phylogenetic Tree Building**
- Hierarchical clustering methods (UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining, etc.)
- Tree structure representation
- Preserving evolutionary relationships

### 4. **Dendrogram Visualization**
- Visual representation of the hierarchical tree
- Branch lengths representing evolutionary distances
- Interactive or static plotting

### 5. **Dynamic Clustering**
- Threshold-based cluster extraction
- Different cut heights yielding different groupings
- Cluster validation and analysis

### Technical Considerations:
- **Libraries**: BioPython, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib/Plotly
- **Performance**: Efficient pairwise computation for large datasets
- **Data structures**: Optimal representation for sequences and trees

Ready to proceed with the implementation details. What would you like to tackle first?
## Prompt 3

**User:** Goal: Setting up technical requirements for all code generated through the conversation. 
Instruction: I need this program to be written in python 3.11, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using pyenv to create the environment and pip to install packages. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow PEP formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified requirement. Apply it to every code generated in further parts of conversation, but do not generate any code for this answer.


**LLM Response:**

## Technical Requirements Confirmed

I acknowledge and will adhere to the following requirements for all code generation:

### Environment & Dependencies

## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

## Task Summary: Needleman-Wunsch Implementation

### Understanding of the Task

I need to implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment of amino acid sequences, with the following specifications:

### Input Files

1. **organisms.json**
   - Format: JSON key-value pairs
   - Key: Species name (string)
   - Value: Amino acid sequence (string)
   - Example: `{"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", ...}`

2. **blosumXX.json** (where XX is 50 or 62)
   - Format: JSON key-value pairs
   - Key types:
     - Single character (e.g., "a"): Gap penalty for that amino acid
     - Two characters (e.g., "ab"): Substitution score from first to second
   - Value: Numerical score
   - Example: `{"a": -1, "b": -2, "ab": -3, "ba": -3, "aa": 2, "bb": 3}`

### Key Requirements

1. **Algorithm Purpose**: Calculate alignment scores between all pairs of species
2. **Scoring System**: 
   - Match/mismatch scores from BLOSUM matrix (e.g., "aa": 2)
   - Gap penalties from single character entries (e.g., "a": -1)
   - Substitution costs from two-character entries (e.g., "ab": -3)
3. **Flexibility**: Support both BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 matrices
4. **Runtime Behavior**: One BLOSUM matrix type per run, but easily switchable

### Implementation Considerations

- Need to parse both JSON files correctly
- Implement full Needleman-Wunsch with dynamic programming
- Handle all pairwise comparisons efficiently
- Store/return alignment scores for subsequent phylogenetic analysis
- Consider memory efficiency for large numbers of sequences

### Output Expected
The algorithm should produce a matrix of alignment scores for all species pairs, which will later be used to construct the phylogenetic tree.

Is this understanding correct? Should I proceed with the implementation?
## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

## Code Description

This implementation provides a complete solution for calculating Needleman-Wunsch alignment scores:

### Key Components:

1. **NeedlemanWunsch Class** (`src/alignment/needleman_wunsch.py`):
   - Implements the classic dynamic programming algorithm
   - Handles BLOSUM matrix loading and score lookups
   - Returns integer scores as required

2. **Data Loading Functions**:
   - `load_organisms()`: Reads species and sequences from JSON
   - `_load_blosum_matrix()`: Loads scoring matrix from JSON

3. **Pairwise Calculation**:
   - `calculate_all_pairwise_scores()`: Computes scores for all species pairs
   - Returns a dictionary with tuple keys for O(1) access
   - Includes self-alignment scores

4. **Test Module** (`src/alignment/test_alignment.py`):
   - Verifies the implementation with your test case
   - Expected output: 7 for the given example

5. **Main Script** (`main.py`):
   - Orchestrates the entire process
   - Saves results to `output/pairwise_scores.json`

### Features:
- Modular design for easy extension
- Efficient dictionary-based score storage
- Proper error handling
- PEP 8 compliant code
- Integer-only scores as requested

The pairwise scores are stored in a dictionary with tuple keys `(species1, species2)`, providing O(1) access time for subsequent phylogenetic tree construction.
## Prompt 6

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

## Code Description

### Key Modifications:

1. **New Module** (`src/alignment/score_io.py`):
   - `save_scores_to_json()`: Saves scores with concatenated species names as keys
   - Automatically extracts BLOSUM version from filename
   - Creates output files named `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`

2. **Updated Main Script**:
   - Accepts BLOSUM file as command-line argument
   - Example usage: `python main.py blosum50.json`
   - Defaults to `blosum62.json` if not specified

3. **Utility Script** (`run_analysis.py`):
   - Convenience script to run analysis with both BLOSUM matrices
   - Useful for batch processing

### Features:

- **Automatic Naming**: Output files are named based on the BLOSUM matrix used
- **Flexible Input**: Can specify which BLOSUM matrix to use
- **Key Format**: Species names concatenated with underscore (e.g., "Horse_Wild boar")
- **Integer Values**: All scores stored as integers as required
- **Intermediate Storage**: Results saved for use in subsequent steps

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Run with default BLOSUM62
python main.py

# Run with BLOSUM50
python main.py blosum50.json

# Run with both matrices
python run_analysis.py
```

The saved JSON files will have the structure:
```json
{
  "Wild boar_Horse": 125,
  "Wild boar_Wild boar": 200,
  "Horse_Wild boar": 125,
  "Horse_Horse": 195
}
```

This modification maintains all the original functionality while adding the required file saving capability with proper naming conventions based on the BLOSUM matrix used.
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

## Task Summary: Phylogenetic Tree Construction

### Understanding of the Task

I need to build a phylogenetic tree using the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores from the previous task, with several important considerations:

### Core Requirements

1. **Tree Construction Method**:
   - Agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach
   - Single linkage methodology
   - **Critical**: Work with SIMILARITY scores (not distances)
   - Merge nodes with HIGHEST similarity first (opposite of typical distance-based clustering)

2. **Tree Structure Properties**:
   - Bottom nodes: Most similar species (highest scores)
   - Internal nodes: Common ancestors
   - Root node: Origin of life (conceptually)
   - Must preserve raw Needleman-Wunsch scores throughout

### Important Distinctions

- **Similarity vs Distance**: Most clustering libraries use distance metrics (lower = closer)
- Our data uses similarity scores (higher = closer)
- Must NOT convert to distances, as future operations depend on raw scores
- Tree structure must maintain original score values

### Future Requirements to Consider

1. **Threshold-based Clustering**:
   - Will need to cut tree at different similarity thresholds
   - Thresholds come directly from score range (e.g., 850, 910, 980 from range 800-1000)
   - Must be able to extract clusters at any given threshold value

2. **Visualization Requirements**:
   - Generate dendrogram visualization
   - Export tree in Newick format (standard phylogenetic tree format)

### Technical Considerations

1. **Data Structure Design**:
   - Need to store tree hierarchy
   - Preserve merge heights (similarity scores at each merge)
   - Enable efficient threshold-based cluster extraction
   - Support traversal for Newick format generation

2. **Algorithm Approach**:
   - Start with each species as individual cluster
   - Iteratively merge clusters with highest similarity
   - Single linkage: similarity between clusters = max similarity between any pair
   - Track merge history and scores

3. **Implementation Challenges**:
   - Cannot directly use scipy.cluster.hierarchy (distance-based)
   - Need custom implementation or careful adaptation
   - Must maintain score interpretation throughout

### Input/Output

- **Input**: `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` with similarity scores
- **Process**: Build hierarchical tree preserving similarity semantics
- **Output**: Tree structure ready for:
  - Threshold-based clustering
  - Dendrogram visualization
  - Newick format export

Is this understanding correct? Should I proceed with designing a solution that maintains similarity scores throughout the tree construction?
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

## Code Solution for Newick Format Export

I'll modify the existing code to support both Newick format variations with proper file naming based on the BLOSUM version used.

## Prompt 10

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for drawing a dendrogram of created tree.
Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

## Code Solution for Dendrogram Visualization

I'll add dendrogram visualization functionality that creates horizontal dendrograms with x-coordinates based on Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.

## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

## Task Summary: Threshold-Based Clustering

### Understanding of the Task

I need to implement threshold-based clustering that extracts groups of species from the phylogenetic tree based on similarity thresholds.

### Core Requirements

1. **Input File**:
   - File name: `thresholds.txt`
   - Format: One integer threshold value per line
   - Example content:
     ```
     1260
     1150
     980
     ```

2. **Clustering Logic**:
   - For each threshold value, "cut" the tree horizontally
   - Any tree structure above (with similarity > threshold) is ignored
   - Find which leaf nodes (species) remain connected below the threshold
   - These connected components form the clusters

3. **Important Constraints**:
   - Thresholds are raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores (integers)
   - Thresholds will be within the range of calculated similarity scores
   - Must work with the tree structure that preserves original scores

### Clustering Process

For a given threshold T:
1. Traverse the tree from root
2. When encountering a node with height > T, stop traversing that branch
3. All leaves still connected below the threshold form a cluster
4. Species that merge only above the threshold are in separate clusters

### Example Scenario

If the tree has merges at heights: 1300, 1200, 1100, 900
- Threshold 1260: Cut between 1300 and 1200, resulting in clusters based on merges ≤ 1200
- Threshold 1150: Cut between 1200 and 1100, resulting in more clusters
- Threshold 980: Cut between 1100 and 900, resulting in even more clusters

### Expected Output

For each threshold, I need to:
- Identify all clusters of species
- Each cluster contains species that are still connected at that threshold
- Lower thresholds generally result in more, smaller clusters
- Higher thresholds result in fewer, larger clusters

### Integration with Previous Work

This task directly uses:
- The phylogenetic tree built in Task 2
- The height values (similarity scores) stored in tree nodes
- The tree traversal capabilities already implemented

The `get_clusters_at_threshold()` method already implemented in the `PhylogeneticTree` class appears to provide this exact functionality.

Is this understanding correct? Should I proceed with implementing the threshold file reading and cluster extraction functionality?
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

## Code Solution for Threshold-Based Clustering

I'll add functionality to read thresholds and generate clusters, saving them in the specified format.

# Phylogenetic Clustering Analysis

A Python implementation for phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences using Needleman-Wunsch alignment, hierarchical clustering, and threshold-based species grouping.

## Features

- **Sequence Alignment**: Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with BLOSUM scoring matrices
- **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**: Single-linkage hierarchical clustering
- **Visualization**: Horizontal dendrograms with similarity-based distances
- **Clustering**: Threshold-based species grouping
- **Multiple Output Formats**: JSON, Newick, and PNG visualizations

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pyenv (recommended for environment management)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd phylogenetic-clustering
```

2. Create a Python environment using pyenv:
```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 phylogenetic-env
pyenv activate phylogenetic-env
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input Files

The program requires the following input files in the project root:

1. **`organisms.json`**: Species and their amino acid sequences
   ```json
   {
     "Species1": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL",
     "Species2": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"
   }
   ```

2. **`blosumXX.json`**: BLOSUM scoring matrix (XX = 50 or 62)
   ```json
   {
     "a": -1,
     "b": -2,
     "ab": -3,
     "aa": 2,
     "bb": 3
   }
   ```

3. **`thresholds.txt`**: Clustering thresholds (one per line)
   ```
   1260
   1150
   980
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the complete analysis with default BLOSUM62:
```bash
python main.py
```

Run with BLOSUM50:
```bash
python main.py blosum50.json
```

### Run Analysis for Both BLOSUM Matrices

```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

### Test Clustering Functionality

```bash
python test_clustering.py
```

## Output Files

The program generates the following output files:

1. **Alignment Scores**: `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`
2. **Newick Formats**:
   - Simple: `tree_blosumXX_newick.nw`
   - With distances: `tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`
3. **Dendrogram**: `phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png`
4. **Clusters**: `clusters_for_blosumXX.json`
5. **Analysis Plots**: `cluster_analysis_blosumXX.png`

## Project Structure

- `src/alignment/`: Needleman-Wunsch implementation
- `src/tree/`: Phylogenetic tree construction
- `src/visualization/`: Dendrogram generation
- `src/clustering/`: Threshold-based clustering

## Algorithm Details

### Needleman-Wunsch Alignment
- Global sequence alignment with affine gap penalties
- Scoring based on BLOSUM substitution matrices
- Returns integer similarity scores

### Tree Construction
- Single-linkage hierarchical clustering
- Uses similarity scores (not distances)
- Heights represent merge similarity values

### Clustering
- Cuts tree at specified thresholds
- Identifies connected components
- Groups species below threshold values
