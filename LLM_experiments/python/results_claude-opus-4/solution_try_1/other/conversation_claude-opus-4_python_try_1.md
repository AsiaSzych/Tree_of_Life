## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  


**LLM Response:**

## Project Summary

You need to build a phylogenetic analysis system that:
1. Takes amino acid sequences from different species as input
2. Calculates pairwise similarities using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a predefined substitution matrix
3. Constructs a phylogenetic tree from the similarity scores
4. Visualizes the tree as a dendrogram
5. Performs hierarchical clustering with adjustable thresholds

## Key Project Aspects

### 1. **Input Processing**
- Handle amino acid sequences (likely in FASTA format or similar)
- Parse and validate sequences for multiple species
- Store species-sequence mappings efficiently

### 2. **Similarity Calculation**
- Implement Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment
- Use predefined substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM, PAM)
- Generate a distance/similarity matrix for all species pairs
- Consider optimization for O(n²) pairwise comparisons

### 3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
- Convert similarity scores to distance measures
- Implement hierarchical clustering algorithm (e.g., UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining)
- Build tree structure maintaining branch lengths

### 4. **Visualization**
- Generate dendrogram representation
- Display species names and branch lengths
- Support interactive or static output

### 5. **Clustering Analysis**
- Implement threshold-based cluster extraction
- Allow dynamic threshold adjustment
- Output cluster assignments for different cutoff values

### Technical Considerations:
- **Libraries**: Consider using BioPython for sequence handling, NumPy for matrix operations, SciPy for clustering, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- **Performance**: Needleman-Wunsch is O(mn) per pair; consider parallelization for large datasets
- **Data structures**: Efficient storage for distance matrix and tree representation

Ready to start with any specific component of this project. Which part would you like to tackle first?
## Prompt 3

**User:** Goal: Setting up technical requirements for all code generated through the conversation. 
Instruction: I need this program to be written in python 3.11, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using pyenv to create the environment and pip to install packages. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow PEP formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified requirement. Apply it to every code generated in further parts of conversation, but do not generate any code for this answer.


**LLM Response:**

## Technical Requirements Confirmed

I understand and will adhere to the following requirements for all code generation throughout this project:

### Environment & Dependencies
- **Python version**: 3.11
- **Environment management**: pyenv
- **Package management**: pip
- **Dependencies**: I'll select appropriate libraries and provide a `requirements.txt` file when needed

### Code Standards
- **Style**: Full PEP 8 compliance
- **Type hints**: Will include type annotations for better code clarity
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all functions/classes
- **Error handling**: Proper exception handling for production readiness
- **Code organization**: Clean, modular, and efficient implementation

### File System Conventions
- **Base path**: All paths will be relative to the current directory (`./`)
- **Structure**: Will use appropriate subfolders (e.g., `./data/`, `./output/`, `./src/`)
- **File naming**: Each code snippet will include the target filename at the top
- **Path handling**: Will use `pathlib` for cross-platform compatibility

### Production Requirements
- **Logging**: Appropriate logging instead of print statements
- **Configuration**: Externalized configuration where applicable
- **Testing**: Will suggest test cases and structure
- **Performance**: Optimized algorithms and data structures
- **Scalability**: Code designed to handle various dataset sizes

I'm ready to begin implementing your phylogenetic analysis project with these specifications. Each code block I provide will be clearly marked with its intended filename and location.
## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

## Task Summary: Needleman-Wunsch Implementation

I understand the requirements for implementing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for your phylogenetic analysis project. Here's my understanding:

### Input Files

1. **organisms.json**
   - JSON file with species-sequence mappings
   - Key: Species name (string)
   - Value: Amino acid sequence (string)
   - Located in current directory

2. **blosumXX.json** (where XX is 50 or 62)
   - JSON file containing BLOSUM substitution matrix scores
   - Key formats:
     - Single character (e.g., "a"): Gap penalty for that amino acid
     - Two characters (e.g., "ab"): Substitution score from first to second amino acid
   - Value: Numerical score (positive for matches, negative for mismatches/gaps)
   - Only one BLOSUM matrix used per run, but code should support switching between runs

### Algorithm Requirements

1. **Purpose**: Global sequence alignment of amino acid sequences between species pairs
2. **Scoring System**:
   - Match/mismatch scores from BLOSUM matrix (two-character keys)
   - Gap penalties from BLOSUM matrix (single-character keys)
   - Note: The gap penalty structure is unusual - typically Needleman-Wunsch uses a uniform gap penalty, but here each amino acid has its own deletion cost
3. **Output**: Alignment score for each pair of species
4. **Scale**: Need to handle multiple pairwise comparisons (all-vs-all species comparisons)

### Key Considerations

- The BLOSUM matrix format is non-standard (typically BLOSUM is a symmetric matrix, not key-value pairs)
- Gap penalties are amino acid-specific rather than uniform
- Need efficient implementation as we'll compute O(n²) pairwise alignments
- Should design for easy switching between BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62

Ready to proceed with the implementation when you're ready. Should I start with the core Needleman-Wunsch algorithm or the file parsing utilities first?
## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

## Code Description

This implementation provides a modular solution for calculating Needleman-Wunsch alignment scores:

1. **`sequence_alignment.py`**: Core implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
   - Handles the unique BLOSUM matrix format with amino acid-specific gap penalties
   - Uses numpy for efficient matrix operations
   - Returns integer scores as required

2. **`data_loader.py`**: Handles file I/O operations
   - Loads organism sequences from JSON
   - Loads BLOSUM matrices with configurable type (50 or 62)

3. **`similarity_calculator.py`**: Orchestrates the pairwise calculations
   - Calculates scores for all species pairs
   - Stores results in a dictionary with O(1) lookup time
   - Includes both (A,B) and (B,A) for convenience

4. **`main.py`**: Entry point with command-line interface
   - Allows selection of BLOSUM matrix type
   - Configurable logging levels
   - Production-ready error handling

5. **`test_alignment.py`**: Verification script for the example test case

The scores are stored in a dictionary with tuple keys `(species1, species2)` for fast O(1) access, which will be essential for the subsequent tree-building algorithms.
## Prompt 6

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

## Code Description

The modifications add file saving functionality while maintaining the existing in-memory storage:

1. **New `score_saver.py`**:
   - `ScoreSaver` class handles all file I/O for scores
   - `save_scores()` converts tuple keys to concatenated strings with underscore
   - Saves to `organisms_scores_blosum50.json` or `organisms_scores_blosum62.json`
   - `load_scores()` method for reading saved results (useful for later tasks)

2. **Modified `similarity_calculator.py`**:
   - Added `ScoreSaver` instance
   - `calculate_all_pairs()` now has optional `save_to_file` parameter
   - Automatically saves results after calculation

3. **Modified `main.py`**:
   - Added `--no-save` flag to optionally disable file saving
   - Displays the output filename in logs
   - Better logging of which BLOSUM matrix is being used

4. **New `load_scores_example.py`**:
   - Utility script demonstrating how to load saved scores
   - Useful for verifying saved data or for subsequent tasks

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Calculate with BLOSUM62 (default) and save
python main.py

# Calculate with BLOSUM50 and save
python main.py --blosum 50

# Calculate without saving to file
python main.py --no-save

# Load previously saved scores
python load_scores_example.py
```

The saved JSON files will have the format:
```json
{
  "Species1_Species2": 123,
  "Species1_Species3": 456,
  "Species2_Species3": 789,
  ...
}
```

This intermediate storage format allows easy access to scores for the upcoming phylogenetic tree construction tasks.
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description.

## Task Summary: Phylogenetic Tree Construction

I understand the requirements for building a phylogenetic tree using the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores. Here's my understanding:

### Core Requirements

1. **Tree Construction Method**:
   - Build a phylogenetic tree using agglomerative hierarchical clustering
   - Use **single linkage** methodology
   - **Critical**: Work with **similarity scores** (higher = more similar), NOT distances
   - Merge nodes with **highest similarity** first (they'll be at bottom of tree)
   - Internal nodes represent common ancestors
   - Root represents the origin of life

2. **Input Data**:
   - Use Needleman-Wunsch scores from `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`
   - Scores are similarity measures (e.g., range 800-1000)
   - Higher scores indicate more closely related species

3. **Tree Structure Requirements**:
   - Must preserve raw Needleman-Wunsch scores in the tree structure
   - Support threshold-based clustering using original score values
   - Example: If scores range 800-1000, thresholds might be 850, 910, 980
   - Tree must allow extraction of clusters at any given threshold

### Future Task Requirements

1. **Dendrogram Visualization**:
   - Need to generate visual dendrogram representation
   - Y-axis should show similarity scores (not distances)

2. **Newick Format Export**:
   - Save tree in standard Newick text format
   - Preserve branch lengths based on similarity scores

3. **Threshold-based Clustering**:
   - Read thresholds from `thresholds.txt` file
   - Extract clusters at each threshold level
   - Thresholds are raw Needleman-Wunsch scores

### Key Considerations

1. **Similarity vs Distance**:
   - Most clustering libraries expect distances (lower = more similar)
   - Our data is similarities (higher = more similar)
   - Need custom implementation or careful adaptation
   - Must NOT simply convert similarities to distances, as thresholds depend on raw scores

2. **Data Structure Design**:
   - Tree nodes must store:
     - Species names (for leaf nodes)
     - Similarity score at which nodes merged
     - Child nodes
     - Branch lengths for Newick format
   - Must support efficient cluster extraction at any threshold

3. **Algorithm Approach**:
   - Start with each species as a leaf node
   - Iteratively merge the pair with highest similarity
   - Track merge heights (similarity scores)
   - Build tree bottom-up until single root remains

4. **Single Linkage**:
   - When merging clusters, use the maximum similarity between any pair of species from the two clusters
   - This is the "closest" pair approach

Ready to proceed with the implementation when you're ready. The solution will need to carefully handle the similarity-based approach while maintaining compatibility with standard phylogenetic tree operations.
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

## Code Modification for Newick Format Export

I'll modify the tree structures and add functionality to save trees in both Newick format variants:

## Prompt 10

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for drawing a dendrogram of created tree.
Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

## Code Modification for Dendrogram Visualization

I'll add functionality to create a horizontal dendrogram with x-coordinates based on Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores:

## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

## Task Summary: Threshold-Based Clustering

I understand the requirements for the final clustering task. Here's my understanding:

### Core Requirements

1. **Input File**:
   - File name: `thresholds.txt`
   - Format: One integer value per line
   - Example content:
     ```
     1260
     1150
     980
     ```
   - Values are from the same range as Needleman-Wunsch scores (e.g., 800-1000)

2. **Clustering Method**:
   - Cut the phylogenetic tree at each threshold value
   - "Forget" everything above the threshold (nodes with height > threshold)
   - Find which leaf nodes (species) remain connected below the threshold
   - These connected components form the clusters

3. **How It Works**:
   - For each threshold value:
     - Traverse the tree from root
     - When encountering a node with height ≥ threshold, stop traversing that branch
     - All leaf nodes (species) that can still be reached from the same sub-tree below the threshold form a cluster
   - Example: If threshold is 1260 and two species merge at height 1200, they're in the same cluster

### Key Considerations

1. **Threshold Interpretation**:
   - Thresholds are raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores
   - Higher threshold = more stringent clustering (fewer, smaller clusters)
   - Lower threshold = more permissive clustering (fewer, larger clusters)

2. **Expected Output**:
   - For each threshold, identify all clusters
   - Each cluster is a group of species names
   - Need to handle edge cases:
     - Threshold above root height: each species is its own cluster
     - Threshold below all merge points: all species in one cluster

3. **Implementation Notes**:
   - The tree structure already has the `find_clusters_at_threshold()` method prepared for this
   - Need to read thresholds from file
   - Process each threshold independently
   - Output results in a clear, organized format

### Example Scenario
If we have a tree where:
- Species A and B merge at height 1200
- Species C and D merge at height 1150
- (A,B) and (C,D) merge at height 1000

Then:
- Threshold 1260: Four clusters: {A}, {B}, {C}, {D}
- Threshold 1180: Two clusters: {A,B}, {C,D}
- Threshold 950: One cluster: {A,B,C,D}

Ready to implement the clustering functionality when you're ready.
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

## Code Modification for Threshold-Based Clustering

I'll add functionality to read thresholds, calculate clusters, and save results:

# Phylogenetic Analysis Pipeline

A Python-based pipeline for phylogenetic analysis using Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment, hierarchical clustering, and threshold-based species clustering.

## Features

- **Sequence Alignment**: Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with customizable BLOSUM matrices
- **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**: Single-linkage hierarchical clustering
- **Visualization**: Horizontal dendrograms with similarity-based distances
- **Clustering Analysis**: Threshold-based species clustering
- **Multiple Output Formats**: JSON, Newick, and PNG visualizations

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pip package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd phylogenetic-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input Files

The pipeline requires the following input files in the project root:

1. **organisms.json**: Species names and amino acid sequences
   ```json
   {
     "Species1": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL",
     "Species2": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"
   }
   ```

2. **blosum50.json** or **blosum62.json**: BLOSUM substitution matrices
   ```json
   {
     "A": -1,
     "AA": 4,
     "AC": 0,
     ...
   }
   ```

3. **thresholds.txt**: Clustering thresholds (one per line)
   ```
   1260
   1150
   980
   ```

## Usage

### Full Pipeline
Run the complete analysis pipeline:
```bash
python main.py --full-pipeline --blosum 62
```

### Individual Steps

1. **Calculate similarity scores only**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --blosum 62
   ```

2. **Build tree from existing scores**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --tree-only --blosum 62
   ```

3. **Generate all outputs**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --build-tree --save-newick --draw-dendrogram --analyze-clusters --blosum 62
   ```

4. **Analyze clusters only**:
   ```bash
   python analyze_clusters_standalone.py --blosum 62
   ```

### Command-line Options

- `--blosum {50,62}`: Choose BLOSUM matrix type (default: 62)
- `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}`: Set logging level (default: INFO)
- `--no-save`: Don't save similarity scores to file
- `--build-tree`: Build phylogenetic tree after calculating scores
- `--tree-only`: Build tree from existing scores file
- `--save-newick`: Save tree in Newick formats
- `--draw-dendrogram`: Generate dendrogram visualization
- `--analyze-clusters`: Perform threshold-based clustering analysis
- `--full-pipeline`: Run all steps

## Output Files

The pipeline generates the following output files:

1. **organisms_scores_blosum{50,62}.json**: Pairwise similarity scores
2. **tree_blosum{50,62}_newick.nw**: Simple Newick format (topology only)
3. **tree_blosum{50,62}_newick_with_distance.nw**: Newick with branch lengths
4. **phylogenetic_tree_blosum{50,62}.png**: Dendrogram visualization
5. **clusters_for_blosum{50,62}.json**: Clustering results for all thresholds

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the Needleman-Wunsch implementation:
```bash
python test_alignment.py
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Ensure input files are in place
ls organisms.json blosum62.json thresholds.txt

# 2. Run full analysis
python main.py --full-pipeline --blosum 62

# 3. View results
cat clusters_for_blosum62.json
```
