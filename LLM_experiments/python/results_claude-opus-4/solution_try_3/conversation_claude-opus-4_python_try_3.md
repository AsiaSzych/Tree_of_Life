## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  

**LLM Response:**

## Project Summary

You need to build a phylogenetic clustering system for amino acid sequences across different species. The project involves:

1. **Input**: Amino acid sequences from multiple species
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a predefined substitution scoring matrix
3. **Tree Construction**: Building a phylogenetic tree from pairwise similarity scores
4. **Visualization**: Creating a dendrogram representation
5. **Clustering**: Identifying species clusters based on variable similarity thresholds

## Key Project Aspects

### 1. **Sequence Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch)**
- Global alignment algorithm for comparing amino acid sequences
- Requires substitution matrix (e.g., BLOSUM, PAM)
- Produces optimal alignment scores for all sequence pairs
- Time complexity: O(mn) per pair

### 2. **Distance/Similarity Matrix**
- Convert alignment scores to distance metrics
- Create symmetric matrix for all species pairs
- Critical for hierarchical clustering

### 3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
- Hierarchical clustering methods (e.g., UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining)
- Tree structure representing evolutionary relationships
- Distance-based approach using similarity scores

### 4. **Dendrogram Visualization**
- Visual representation of the hierarchical tree
- Branch lengths proportional to evolutionary distances
- Interactive threshold selection capability

### 5. **Dynamic Clustering**
- Cut tree at different heights (thresholds)
- Generate clusters based on similarity levels
- Flexible cluster analysis for different research needs

### Technical Considerations:
- **Performance**: O(n²) pairwise comparisons needed
- **Memory**: Large distance matrices for many species
- **Libraries**: Consider BioPython, scipy.cluster, matplotlib/seaborn
- **Data Structure**: Efficient storage of sequences and results

Ready to proceed with implementation details for any of these components.
## Prompt 3

I'm ready to implement your phylogenetic clustering project following these specifications. Please provide your next requirement or request for code generation.
## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

## Task 1 Summary: Needleman-Wunsch Implementation

### Understanding of the Requirements

**Algorithm Purpose**: Implement Needleman-Wunsch for global alignment of amino acid sequences between different species pairs.

### Input Files

1. **organisms.json**
   - Format: JSON key-value pairs
   - Key: Species name (string)
   - Value: Amino acid sequence (string)
   - Example: `{"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"}`

2. **blosumXX.json** (where XX = 50 or 62)
   - Format: JSON key-value pairs representing BLOSUM substitution matrix
   - Key types:
     - Single character (e.g., "a"): Gap penalty for that amino acid
     - Two characters (e.g., "ab"): Substitution score between amino acids
   - Value: Numerical score
   - Example interpretation:
     - `"a": -1` → Gap penalty for amino acid 'a'
     - `"ab": -3` → Substitution score for replacing 'a' with 'b'
     - `"aa": 2` → Match score for identical amino acids

### Key Implementation Considerations

1. **Pairwise Comparisons**: Need to calculate alignment scores for all possible species pairs
2. **Matrix Flexibility**: Code should handle both BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 matrices
3. **Runtime Configuration**: Matrix type can change between program runs (not during execution)
4. **Score Calculation**: Standard Needleman-Wunsch with:
   - Match/mismatch scores from BLOSUM matrix
   - Gap penalties from single-character entries
   - Global alignment (full sequence alignment)

### Expected Functionality
- Load organism sequences from JSON
- Load appropriate BLOSUM matrix based on configuration
- Calculate optimal alignment scores for all species pairs
- Store/return pairwise similarity scores for phylogenetic tree construction

### Technical Notes
- Need efficient implementation due to O(n²) pairwise comparisons
- Consider memory usage for large sequence sets
- Results will feed into distance matrix for clustering

Ready to proceed with the implementation when you're ready for code generation.
## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

## Needleman-Wunsch Implementation for Amino Acid Sequence Alignment

### Code Description

This implementation provides a modular solution for calculating Needleman-Wunsch alignment scores between amino acid sequences. The code is organized into three main components:

1. **Data Loading Module** (`src/data_loader.py`): Handles reading organism sequences and BLOSUM matrices from JSON files
2. **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm** (`src/needleman_wunsch.py`): Implements the core alignment algorithm with integer scoring
3. **Main Processing Script** (`src/sequence_aligner.py`): Orchestrates the alignment process for all species pairs

The results are stored in a dictionary with tuple keys `(species1, species2)` for fast O(1) access in subsequent clustering steps.

### Key Features

1. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into data loading, algorithm implementation, and orchestration
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error messages
3. **Logging**: Production-ready logging for monitoring execution
4. **Efficient Storage**: Results stored in dictionary with O(1) access time
5. **Integer Scores**: All calculations use integer arithmetic as required
6. **Flexible Configuration**: Easy to switch between BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62

The alignment scores are stored in a dictionary with tuple keys, making them readily accessible for the subsequent phylogenetic tree construction phase of your project.
## Prompt 6

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

## Modified Code for Saving Alignment Scores

### Code Description

I've added functionality to save the calculated Needleman-Wunsch scores to JSON files. The modifications include:

1. **New method `save_scores()`** in the `SequenceAligner` class that formats and saves scores to JSON
2. **Automatic file naming** based on the BLOSUM matrix type used (e.g., `organisms_scores_blosum62.json`)
3. **Key formatting** that concatenates species names with underscore (e.g., `"species1_species2"`)
4. **Consistent ordering** of species names in keys (alphabetically sorted)

### Key Modifications

1. **`save_scores()` method**:
   - Converts tuple keys to string format with underscore separator
   - Automatically names file based on BLOSUM type
   - Sorts keys for consistent output
   - Returns filepath for confirmation

2. **`load_scores()` method**:
   - Loads previously saved scores from JSON
   - Converts string keys back to tuples
   - Useful for resuming work or sharing results

3. **File naming convention**:
   - `organisms_scores_blosum50.json` for BLOSUM50
   - `organisms_scores_blosum62.json` for BLOSUM62

4. **JSON structure example**:
```json
{
  "species1_species2": 42,
  "species1_species3": 38,
  "species2_species3": 45
}
```

The code maintains all previous functionality while adding persistent storage of results, making it suitable for the intermediate step in your phylogenetic analysis pipeline.
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

## Task 2 Summary: Phylogenetic Tree Construction

### Understanding of the Requirements

**Main Objective**: Build a phylogenetic tree using Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a measure of evolutionary relationships between species.

### Key Concepts

1. **Tree Construction Method**:
   - Agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach
   - Single linkage methodology
   - **Critical distinction**: Using SIMILARITY scores (not distances)
   - Highest similarity = merge first (closest evolutionary relationship)
   - Bottom-up construction (leaves → root)

2. **Tree Interpretation**:
   - Leaves: Individual species
   - Internal nodes: Common ancestors
   - Root: Origin of life (most ancient common ancestor)
   - Branch lengths: Related to similarity scores

### Important Considerations

1. **Similarity vs Distance**:
   - Most clustering libraries use distance metrics (lower = closer)
   - This project uses similarity scores (higher = closer)
   - Must NOT convert to distances as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores are needed later
   - Tree structure must preserve original similarity values

2. **Threshold-based Clustering**:
   - Future requirement to cut tree at different similarity thresholds
   - Thresholds will be raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (e.g., 850, 910, 980)
   - Tree structure must support querying clusters at any threshold value
   - Example: If scores range 800-1000, threshold of 910 should group species with similarity ≥ 910

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - **Dendrogram visualization**: Graphical representation of the tree
   - **Newick format**: Text-based tree representation for interoperability
   - Both outputs needed for later tasks

### Technical Implications

1. **Data Structure Design**:
   - Must store original similarity scores at each merge point
   - Need to track merge heights (similarity levels)
   - Support efficient threshold queries
   - Maintain tree topology for visualization

2. **Algorithm Approach**:
   - Cannot use standard scipy linkage (distance-based)
   - Need custom implementation or adaptation
   - Single linkage: When merging clusters, use maximum similarity between any pair

3. **Tree Properties to Preserve**:
   - Merge heights = similarity scores at which clusters joined
   - Original pairwise similarities between species
   - Cluster membership at any threshold level
   - Full tree topology for Newick export

### Expected Functionality
- Load similarity scores from JSON file
- Build hierarchical tree preserving similarity values
- Support cutting tree at arbitrary thresholds
- Enable dendrogram visualization
- Export to Newick format
- Maintain compatibility with raw Needleman-Wunsch scores throughout

This is essentially building a similarity-based dendrogram where the y-axis represents Needleman-Wunsch scores, and horizontal cuts at different heights produce different clustering solutions.
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

## Phylogenetic Tree Construction Implementation

### Code Description

This implementation adds a custom phylogenetic tree builder that:

1. **Tree Node Structure** (`src/tree_node.py`): Defines nodes that can represent both species (leaves) and ancestors (internal nodes)
2. **Phylogenetic Tree Builder** (`src/phylogenetic_tree.py`): Implements single-linkage clustering using similarity scores
3. **Tree Utilities** (`src/tree_utils.py`): Provides helper functions for tree traversal and analysis

The key innovation is that this implementation works directly with similarity scores (not distances) and preserves the raw Needleman-Wunsch values as node heights, which will be crucial for threshold-based clustering.

## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

## Modified Code for Newick Format Export

### Code Description

I've modified the tree structure to support two different Newick format exports:

1. **Simple Newick**: Only leaf names, no branch lengths (e.g., `(A,B,(C,D));`)
2. **Newick with Distances**: Includes branch lengths as integers (e.g., `(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);`)

The key modifications include:
- Updated `TreeNode` class with two Newick conversion methods
- Enhanced `PhylogeneticTree` class with methods to save both formats
- Branch length calculations that preserve integer values from Needleman-Wunsch scores

## Prompt 10

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for drawing a dendrogram of created tree.
Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

## Dendrogram Visualization Implementation

### Code Description

I've added dendrogram visualization functionality that:

1. **Dendrogram Plotter** (`src/dendrogram.py`): Creates horizontal dendrograms with x-axis representing Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores
2. **Visualization Features**:
   - Horizontal layout (species on y-axis, similarity scores on x-axis)
   - Branch positions determined by actual similarity scores
   - Clean, professional appearance with labeled axes
   - Automatic scaling and spacing

The dendrogram visually represents the hierarchical clustering, where the x-position of each merge corresponds to the similarity score at which those clusters were joined.

## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

## Task 3 Summary: Threshold-Based Clustering

### Understanding of the Requirements

**Main Objective**: Identify clusters of species by cutting the phylogenetic tree at specified similarity thresholds.

### Key Concepts

1. **Input File**:
   - File name: `thresholds.txt`
   - Format: One integer threshold value per line
   - Example content:
     ```
     1260
     1150
     980
     ```

2. **Clustering Logic**:
   - Each threshold represents a horizontal cut through the dendrogram
   - "Everything above this threshold is forgot" = ignore merges that happened at higher similarity scores
   - Find which leaf nodes (species) remain connected below the threshold
   - Connected components form the clusters

3. **Threshold Properties**:
   - Values are raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (integers)
   - Range matches the similarity scores from Task 1
   - Higher threshold = more stringent clustering (fewer, smaller clusters)
   - Lower threshold = more permissive clustering (fewer, larger clusters)

### Visual Interpretation

Imagine the dendrogram with x-axis showing similarity scores:
- Drawing a vertical line at threshold value (e.g., x=1260)
- Any branches that merge to the right of this line (similarity > 1260) are "cut"
- Species that remain connected to the left of the line form clusters
- Each disconnected subtree represents one cluster

### Expected Functionality

1. **Load thresholds** from `thresholds.txt`
2. **For each threshold**:
   - Traverse tree and identify where cuts occur
   - Group species that remain connected
   - Output the resulting clusters
3. **Output format** should clearly show:
   - Which threshold was used
   - How many clusters were formed
   - Which species belong to each cluster

### Example Scenario

If tree structure shows:
- Species A and B merge at similarity 1300
- Species C and D merge at similarity 1200
- Clusters (A,B) and (C,D) merge at similarity 1000

Then with threshold 1260:
- Cut happens between 1200 and 1300
- Result: 3 clusters: {A}, {B}, {C,D}

With threshold 1150:
- Cut happens between 1000 and 1200
- Result: 2 clusters: {A,B}, {C,D}

### Implementation Considerations

- Need efficient tree traversal algorithm
- Must handle edge cases (threshold above all merges, below all merges)
- Results should be easily interpretable and possibly saved to file
- The existing `get_clusters_at_threshold()` method in `PhylogeneticTree` class seems designed for this exact purpose
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

## Threshold-Based Clustering Implementation

### Code Description

I've added functionality to read thresholds from a file and generate clusters for each threshold value. The implementation includes:

1. **Cluster Analyzer** (`src/cluster_analyzer.py`): Main module that reads thresholds, generates clusters, and saves results
2. **Threshold Loading**: Reads integer thresholds from `thresholds.txt`
3. **Cluster Generation**: Uses the existing tree structure to find connected components at each threshold
4. **Output**: Both console display and JSON file storage with proper formatting

### Key Features

1. **Threshold Loading**:
   - Reads integer values from `thresholds.txt`
   - Validates input and handles errors gracefully
   - Skips empty lines

2. **Cluster Generation**:
   - Uses existing tree structure efficiently
   - Converts internal sets to sorted lists for consistent output
   - Sorts clusters by size and alphabetically

3. **Output Formats**:
   - **Console**: Human-readable format with cluster sizes and members
   - **JSON**: Machine-readable format for further processing
   - File naming follows the `clusters_for_blosumXX.json` convention

4. **Integration**:
   - Works seamlessly with existing tree structure
   - Can be run independently or as part of the complete pipeline
   - Includes helper functions for different use cases

The cluster analyzer completes the phylogenetic analysis pipeline, allowing you to identify which species group together at different similarity thresholds.
## Prompt 13

**User:** Goal: Checking if provided solution covers all previously mentioned requirements.
Instruction: This was the end of coding tasks for this project. Right now all functionalities should be covered. The final code should start with reading input “blosumXX.json” and “organism.json” files and at the end print clusters for thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file to the standard output. Additionally, saving intermediate outputs as previously mentioned. This will be considered as a successful implementation. Now it is time to check if this implementation covers all requirements. Remember that implemented solutions must be of high quality. 
Expected Output: List of all previously provided requirements with short note on whether or not it is covered in the generated code.

✅ **Flexibility between BLOSUM types**
- Can switch between BLOSUM50/62 between runs
- File naming reflects the type used

✅ **Memory efficiency**
- Efficient data structures used
- No unnecessary data duplication

✅ **Error handling**
- File not found errors
- Invalid JSON format
- Invalid threshold values
- Missing data validation

### Summary

**All requirements have been successfully implemented.** The solution provides:

1. A complete, modular implementation of the phylogenetic analysis pipeline
2. Production-ready code with proper error handling and logging
3. Efficient algorithms and data structures
4. All required file outputs with correct naming conventions
5. Flexibility to work with different BLOSUM matrices
6. Clear separation of concerns across modules

The implementation can be run end-to-end using the main pipeline script or individual components can be used separately for specific tasks.
## Prompt 14

**User:** Goal: Verification of required files and project outline.
Instruction: I need to set up all generated code in the repository. Generate an outline of what files I should have in the repository, including requirements.txt, readMe.md and any other file necessary to set up and start the program.

# Phylogenetic Clustering Analysis

A Python implementation of phylogenetic tree construction and clustering analysis using Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment.

## Features

- Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for amino acid sequence alignment
- Phylogenetic tree construction using single-linkage clustering
- Dendrogram visualization with similarity-based distances
- Threshold-based clustering analysis
- Support for BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 substitution matrices

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- See `requirements.txt` for package dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd phylogenetic-clustering
```

2. Create a virtual environment using pyenv:
```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 phylogenetic-env

```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the package in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Input Files

The pipeline requires three input files:

1. **organisms.json**: Species names and amino acid sequences
   ```json
   {

   ```json
   {
     "a": -1,
     "b": -2,
     "ab": -3,
     "aa": 2,
     "bb": 3
