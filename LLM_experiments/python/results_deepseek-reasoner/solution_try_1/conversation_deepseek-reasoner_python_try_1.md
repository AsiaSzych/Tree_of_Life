## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are given a project that involves:\n1. Input: Amino acid sequences for different species.\n2. Step 1: Calculate pairwise similarity scores using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a predefined substitution matrix (dictionary of swapping scores).\n3. Step 2: Build a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) from the similarity scores.\n4. Step 3: Calculate clusters of species at different similarity thresholds.\n\nImportant aspects to consider:\n- **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm**: This is a global alignment algorithm that finds the best match between two sequences, including gaps. We\'ll need a substitution matrix (scoring matrix for amino acids) and gap penalties.\n- **Pairwise Similarity Calculation**: We have to compute a distance matrix (or similarity matrix) for all pairs of species. Since Needleman-Wunsch produces an alignment score, we may convert that to a distance (if necessary for the tree building) or use the similarity score directly? Note: For phylogenetic trees, we often use distances (like evolutionary distance). We might need to convert the alignment score to a distance. One common way is to normalize the score (e.g., by the length of the alignment) and then use 1 - normalized similarity, but we must be cautious.\n\n- **Building the Phylogenetic Tree**: We\'ll use hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) to build a tree. The common methods are UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining, etc. We need to choose a method. Since the output is a dendrogram, we can use existing libraries (like `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`) that provide functions for dendrogram plotting and cluster formation.\n\n- **Clustering at Thresholds**: From the hierarchical clustering, we can cut the tree at a given distance threshold to get clusters.\n\nOutline of Steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Read the input sequences (probably in FASTA format? or just as a dictionary of species name to sequence).\n   - Predefined substitution matrix (like BLOSUM, PAM, etc.) should be provided or loaded.\n\n2. **Pairwise Distance Calculation**:\n   - For each pair of species, run the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to get the alignment score.\n   - Convert the alignment score to a distance. One way is to compute the normalized similarity (e.g., score divided by the maximum possible score for the two sequences) and then set distance = 1 - normalized similarity. Alternatively, we might use other distance measures. We must be consistent.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Clustering**:\n   - Create a distance matrix (n x n) for n species.\n   - Use a hierarchical clustering algorithm (like UPGMA) to build a tree.\n\n4. **Dendrogram Plotting**:\n   - Use `scipy` and `matplotlib` to plot the dendrogram.\n\n5. **Cluster Extraction**:\n   - For a given threshold, we can cut the dendrogram to get clusters.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n\nWe can break the project into modules:\n\n1. `alignment.py`: Contains the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm implementation.\n2. `distance_matrix.py`: Computes the pairwise distance matrix for all species.\n3. `clustering.py`: Builds the hierarchical clustering model and provides functions to cut the tree and get clusters.\n4. `visualization.py`: Plots the dendrogram.\n5. `main.py`: Orchestrates the whole process.\n\nHowever, note that we can also use existing libraries for alignment (like Biopython) but the requirement says to use Needleman-Wunsch. Since we are to implement from scratch, we\'ll code the algorithm.\n\nBut note: The project does not specify whether to use libraries or not. However, for the tree building and dendrogram, we can use `scipy` and `matplotlib` because implementing a robust hierarchical clustering algorithm is complex.\n\nLet\'s clarify the constraints:\n\n- We are to implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (so we code that).\n- We are allowed to use standard libraries (like numpy, scipy, matplotlib) for the rest.\n\nSteps in code:\n\n1. Implement Needleman-Wunsch:\n   - Input: two sequences, substitution matrix, gap penalty (we\'ll assume linear gap penalty for simplicity).\n   - Output: the best alignment score (and optionally the alignments, but for distance we only need the score).\n\n2. Compute the distance matrix:\n   - We have to compute for each pair the alignment score, then convert to a distance.\n\n3. Build the linkage matrix using `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with the distance matrix.\n\n4. Plot dendrogram using `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram`.\n\n5. Cut the tree at a given threshold to get clusters.\n\nImportant: The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm can be slow for long sequences and many species. We might need to optimize or use a faster method? But the requirement is for Needleman-Wunsch.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a library for the alignment? The requirement says "using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm", so we are expected to implement it.\n\nLet\'s proceed with the implementation.\n\nWe\'ll assume:\n- Gap penalty: constant (e.g., -10 for a gap)\n- Substitution matrix: provided as a dictionary of dictionaries, e.g., `matrix[\'A\'][\'G\'] = 4`\n\nWe\'ll write the Needleman-Wunsch function.\n\nThen, we\'ll compute the distance matrix. We must note that the distance should be symmetric.\n\nWe\'ll have to decide on the normalization: \n  normalized_similarity = score / min(len(seq1), len(seq2))   [not exactly, because the maximum score might be achieved when the sequences are identical?]\n\nAlternatively, we can use the maximum possible score for the two sequences? But that depends on the scoring matrix. \n\nAnother common approach is to use the identity percentage? But we have a substitution matrix.\n\nAlternatively, we can define the distance as: \n  distance = 1 - (score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)\n\nBut we don\'t know the min and max scores in advance.\n\nA simpler approach: use the alignment score as a similarity, then we can use the similarity to build the tree. However, hierarchical clustering in scipy expects distances (dissimilarities). So we need to convert the similarity to distance.\n\nWe can use: \n  distance = max_score - score\n\nBut what is max_score? It\'s the score when aligning a sequence to itself? However, that might not be the maximum possible for two sequences? Actually, the maximum score for two sequences is the score when aligning them without gaps? But that depends on the sequences and the scoring matrix.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the negative of the alignment score as distance? Then we have to use a method that can handle negative distances? Not recommended.\n\nAnother idea: normalize by the maximum of the two self-scores? \n  normalized_score = (2 * score) / (self_score1 + self_score2)\n  then distance = 1 - normalized_score\n\nBut note: the self-score for a sequence is the score when aligned to itself without gaps? That would be the sum of the substitution matrix scores for each amino acid with itself? \n\nBut wait, we have the substitution matrix. The self-score for a sequence s is: \n  self_score = sum( matrix[s[i]][s[i]] for i in range(len(s)) )\n\nThen for two sequences, we can compute the normalized similarity as:\n  similarity = score / sqrt(self_score1 * self_score2)   # cosine similarity style? \n  or \n  similarity = score / max(self_score1, self_score2)\n\nBut I think the standard is to use the identity percentage? However, we have a substitution matrix.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid normalization and use the raw alignment score? But then the distance matrix might not be Euclidean and we have to be cautious with the clustering method.\n\nGiven the complexity, and because the project does not specify, I propose:\n\nWe will use the alignment score as a measure of similarity. Then we convert the similarity to a distance by:\n\n  distance = max_similarity - similarity\n\nwhere `max_similarity` is the maximum value in the similarity matrix? But then the distance matrix would be shifted. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n  distance = -similarity   # but then we get negative values? \n\nActually, we can use the similarity directly in hierarchical clustering? But the common methods require distances. So we must convert.\n\nOne common method in bioinformatics is to use:\n\n  distance = 1 - (similarity / max_possible_similarity)\n\nBut we don\'t know the max_possible_similarity for two sequences? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the self-scores to normalize:\n\n  normalized_similarity = (2 * score) / (self_score(seq1) + self_score(seq2))\n\nthen distance = 1 - normalized_similarity\n\nThis normalized_similarity will be between 0 and 1? Only if the scoring matrix is such that the maximum score for two residues is the same as the diagonal? But that is the case for BLOSUM and PAM.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  self_score1 = score when aligning seq1 to itself (without gaps) = sum( matrix[res][res] for res in seq1 )\n  self_score2 = ... for seq2.\n\n  Then the normalized similarity for the alignment between seq1 and seq2 is: \n        norm_sim = score(seq1, seq2) / min(self_score1, self_score2)   # or by max? \n\nBut we want to normalize so that the self_similarity is 1. So:\n\n        norm_sim = score(seq1, seq2) / sqrt(self_score1 * self_score2)   # geometric mean? \n\nOr:\n\n        norm_sim = 2 * score(seq1, seq2) / (self_score1 + self_score2)   # arithmetic mean? \n\nI think the arithmetic mean is more common.\n\nSo we do:\n\n   norm_sim = 2 * score(seq1, seq2) / (self_score(seq1) + self_score(seq2))\n\n   Then the distance: d = 1 - norm_sim\n\nBut note: if the sequences are identical, then score(seq1,seq2) = self_score1 = self_score2, so norm_sim = (2 * self_score1) / (2 * self_score1) = 1 -> d=0.\n\nIf the sequences are very different, then score(seq1,seq2) might be negative? Then we would get negative norm_sim? Then distance would be >1? \n\nWe must ensure that the scoring matrix is such that the self_score is positive and the alignment score for two sequences is not greater than the self_score? Actually, the self_score is the best possible for that sequence? \n\nBut note: when aligning two different sequences, the score might be negative? Then the normalized similarity would be negative? Then we cannot use 1 - norm_sim.\n\nAlternatively, we can define the distance as:\n\n   d = -log( norm_sim )   # if norm_sim is positive? \n\nBut that is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid normalization and use the raw alignment score? Then we have to use a clustering method that can work with similarity matrix? \n\nIn scipy, the linkage function expects a distance matrix. We can convert a similarity matrix to a distance matrix by:\n\n   distance = max_similarity - similarity\n\nwhere max_similarity is the maximum value in the similarity matrix? Then the distance matrix would be non-negative? But if we have negative similarities, then we shift by the minimum? \n\nBut note: we are not limited to positive similarities? The Needleman-Wunsch can produce negative scores.\n\nGiven the complexity, I propose we do:\n\n   We\'ll compute the raw alignment score for each pair.\n\n   Then we\'ll convert the scores to a distance by:\n\n        dist[i, j] = max_score - score[i, j]\n\n   where max_score is the maximum value in the entire score matrix? Then the distance matrix will be non-negative? But note: if we do that, then the diagonal becomes 0? \n\n   Alternatively, we can set:\n        dist[i, j] = score[i, i] + score[j, j] - 2 * score[i, j]\n\n   This is the same as the squared Euclidean distance? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, we can use the formula for evolutionary distance: \n\n        dist = -log( (score[i,j] - min_score) / (max_possible_score - min_score) ) \n\n   but that is complex and requires knowing the min and max.\n\nGiven the time, and because the project does not specify, I will choose a simpler approach:\n\n   We\'ll compute the similarity matrix S, where S[i,j] = alignment score between species i and j.\n\n   Then we convert to distance matrix D by:\n\n        D[i,j] = S[i,i] + S[j,j] - 2 * S[i,j]\n\n   But note: S[i,i] is the score when aligning the sequence to itself? That is the self_score. Then:\n\n        D[i,j] = self_score_i + self_score_j - 2 * S[i,j]\n\n   This is always non-negative? Because the maximum score for aligning i and j is at most (self_score_i + self_score_j)/2? Not exactly.\n\n   Actually, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality? Not necessarily.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        D[i,j] = 1 - S[i,j] / sqrt(S[i,i]*S[j,j])\n\n   but that might not be a metric.\n\nI think the common practice is to use the normalized similarity and then 1 - normalized_sim.\n\nBut to avoid negative normalized similarity, we can use:\n\n        normalized_sim = max(0, S[i,j] / sqrt(S[i,i]*S[j,j]))\n\n   then D[i,j] = 1 - normalized_sim\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the ratio:\n\n        normalized_sim = S[i,j] / sqrt(S[i,i]*S[j,j])\n\n   and then set D[i,j] = 1 - normalized_sim   even if normalized_sim is negative? Then we might have D[i,j] > 1.\n\nBut that might be acceptable for hierarchical clustering? As long as the distances are non-negative? \n\nWe require non-negative distances.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n        normalized_sim = S[i,j] / sqrt(S[i,i]*S[j,j])\n\n        # If normalized_sim > 1, clip to 1? But that should not happen? \n        # If normalized_sim is negative, we set it to 0? Then distance=1.\n\n        D[i,j] = 1 - min(1, max(0, normalized_sim))\n\nBut that is arbitrary.\n\nGiven the complexity, I propose we use the following:\n\n   We\'ll use the alignment score S[i,j] as a similarity, and then convert to distance by:\n\n        D[i,j] = (S[i,i] + S[j,j])/2 - S[i,j]\n\n   This is the same as: \n\n        D[i,j] = (self_score_i + self_score_j)/2 - S[i,j]\n\n   This is the average self-score minus the alignment score. This ensures that for i=j, D[i,i]=0? \n\n        For i=j: D[i,i] = (S[i,i]+S[i,i])/2 - S[i,i] = 0.\n\n   And for two different sequences, if the alignment score is high, then D[i,j] is low.\n\n   But note: if the sequences are very different, S[i,j] might be negative? Then D[i,j] would be large.\n\n   This formula produces a distance that is symmetric and non-negative? \n\n   It is symmetric: D[i,j] = (a_i + a_j)/2 - S[i,j] = D[j,i].\n\n   Non-negative? We have to check: \n        We know that the best alignment score for two sequences cannot exceed the self-scores? Actually, the alignment score for two sequences cannot be greater than the minimum of the self-scores? Not exactly: because we are using gaps? \n\n   Actually, without gaps, the maximum score for aligning two sequences is the sum of the substitution scores for matching the residues? But if we allow gaps, the score might be less.\n\n   So the alignment score S[i,j] might be less than the self-scores? Then (S[i,i] + S[j,j])/2 might be less than S[i,j]? That would make D[i,j] negative? \n\n   We must avoid negative distances.\n\n   We can use:\n\n        D[i,j] = max(0, (S[i,i] + S[j,j])/2 - S[i,j])\n\n   But that is a hack.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n        D[i,j] = (S[i,i] - S[i,j]) + (S[j,j] - S[i,j]) = S[i,i] + S[j,j] - 2*S[i,j]\n\n   This is the same as the squared Euclidean distance if the scores were inner products? \n\n   Then D[i,j] = S[i,i] + S[j,j] - 2*S[i,j]\n\n   This is always non-negative? Only if S[i,i] + S[j,j] >= 2*S[i,j]. Is that true?\n\n   Consider: S[i,i] is the score of aligning i with itself, which is the best possible for i. Similarly for j. Then the alignment between i and j cannot be better than aligning i with i? But note: the alignment of i and j is a global alignment and might include gaps? \n\n   Actually, the alignment score of i with i (without gaps) is S[i,i]. If we align i and j, we are comparing two different sequences. The score S[i,j] might be greater than S[i,i]? That would be if the scoring matrix is not consistent? \n\n   But typically, the diagonal elements are the highest for each row. And the score for matching two different residues is less than matching the same. So S[i,i] is the maximum for aligning sequence i with any sequence? Not necessarily: because we can have gaps? \n\n   Example: \n        sequence i: "A"\n        sequence j: "AA"\n\n        If we align i to j with a gap:\n\n          A- \n          AA -> score = matrix[\'A\'][\'A\'] + gap_penalty (negative) \n\n        Without gap, we can only align the first A? Then score = matrix[\'A\'][\'A\'].\n\n        But aligning i to itself: \n          A \n          A -> score = matrix[\'A\'][\'A\'].\n\n        So S[i,i] = matrix[\'A\'][\'A\'] = 4 (say)\n        S[i,j] = max( 4 + gap_penalty, 4 )   # if we allow only one gap? Actually, we can align the single A to the first A and leave the second A unaligned? But global alignment requires same length? \n\n        Actually, global alignment extends to the full length. So we have:\n\n          A-\n          AA -> score = matrix[\'A\'][\'A\'] + gap_penalty\n\n        Or\n\n          -A\n          AA -> same.\n\n        So if gap_penalty is -10, then S[i,j] = 4 - 10 = -6.\n\n        Then D[i,j] = 4 + (matrix[\'A\'][\'A\']'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 547, 'total_tokens': 4643, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 64}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 64, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 483}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '5b5d4e46-d8d4-4ec6-b947-b5945e260e27', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--42a3dc5b-3c87-4b1d-b2d5-238c6ec2a2ba-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 547, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 4643, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 64}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 3

**User:** Goal: Setting up technical requirements for all code generated through the conversation. 
Instruction: I need this program to be written in python 3.11, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using pyenv to create the environment and pip to install packages. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow PEP formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified requirement. Apply it to every code generated in further parts of conversation, but do not generate any code for this answer.

We need to clarify.\n\n Since the user will provide input data, we can design to read from a file or take a dictionary in memory.\n\n We\'ll design the code to be flexible.\n\n Important: We must handle that the number of species might be large.

Since it\'s not specified, we\'ll design to let the user choose the normalization method.\n\n   We\'ll provide an option to use:\n\n        distance = max_score - alignment_score\n\n   where max_score is the best possible score for aligning the two sequences? But that is non-trivial.\n\n   Another idea: use the alignment score as a similarity and then use:\n\n        distance = -alignment_score   # if we are using a similarity that we want to invert.\n\n   But hierarchical clustering in scipy expects a "dissimilarity" measure (lower means more similar). And our alignment score: higher is better.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        distance = -alignment_score   OR\n        distance = max_possible_score - alignment_score\n\n   However, max_possible_score is not straightforward. \n\n   I propose: We let the user decide the conversion method. We can provide a function that converts score to distance.\n\n   For now, we can use:\n\n        distance = -alignment_score\n\n   But note: if the alignment score can be negative, then -alignment_score would be positive and larger for more dissimilar sequences.\n\n   This should work. However, we must note that the dendrogram and clustering might be sensitive to the distance measure.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        distance = 1 - (alignment_score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)\n\n   but min_score and max_score for the entire set? That would normalize the entire matrix to [0,1]. But per pair? \n\n   Given the complexity, we\'ll start with a simple method: use negative of the alignment score. And then we can adjust if needed.\n\n Step for hierarchical clustering:\n\n   We\'ll use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with the distance matrix.\n\n   Then, we can plot the dendrogram using `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram`.\n\n   Also, to get clusters at a threshold, we can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster`.\n\n Step for code structure:\n\n   We\'ll create:\n\n   - A module for alignment (needleman_wunsch.py) that has the algorithm and a helper to compute the score.\n   - A module for building the distance matrix (distance_matrix.py) that uses the alignment module.\n   - A module for clustering (clustering.py) that uses the distance matrix to build the tree and get clusters.\n   - A module for visualization (visualization.py) that plots the dendrogram and saves it.\n   - A main script (main.py) that reads input, runs the pipeline, and outputs the dendrogram and clusters.\n\n   We\'ll also write tests for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.\n\n   We\'ll use the following libraries:\n\n      numpy\n      scipy\n      matplotlib\n      Biopython? (we don\'t need it for the algorithm if we write our own, but it has substitution matrices. However, we are given a custom one, so we might not need)\n\n   We\'ll avoid Biopython to keep it lightweight unless we need it for something else.\n\n   We\'ll use:\n\n      pip install numpy scipy matplotlib\n\n   We\'ll structure the project:\n\n      project_root/\n        src/\n          __init__.py\n          needleman_wunsch.py\n          distance_matrix.py\n          clustering.py\n          visualization.py\n          main.py\n        data/\n          sequences.json   # or fasta? we need to know input format\n          substitution_matrix.json\n        tests/\n          test_needleman_wunsch.py\n        output/\n        requirements.txt\n        README.md\n\n   We\'ll assume the input sequences are provided as a dictionary in a JSON file? or in a FASTA file? \n\n   Let\'s decide: We\'ll design the main to read a FASTA file of sequences. Each record is one species.\n\n   Alternatively, we can read from a dictionary in a JSON file: {species_name: sequence_string}\n\n   We\'ll let the user specify the input file and its format.\n\n   For now, we\'ll design for a JSON file that is a dictionary of species to sequence.\n\n   Example: {"human": "ACDEFGHIK...", "mouse": ...}\n\n   We\'ll also read the substitution matrix from a JSON file: a dictionary of dictionaries? or a dictionary with keys as tuples?\n\n   We\'ll design for: \n        substitution_matrix = {\n            (\'A\', \'A\'): 10,\n            (\'A\', \'C\'): -1,\n            ...\n        }\n\n   But note: the matrix might be symmetric? We\'ll assume it is.\n\n   We\'ll also need to know the gap penalty. We can have a configuration file or command-line arguments.\n\n   We\'ll use command-line arguments for gap penalty and file paths.\n\n   We\'ll use argparse in main.py.\n\n   Command-line arguments:\n\n        --sequences: path to the JSON file containing the sequences (default: data/sequences.json)\n        --matrix: path to the JSON file containing the substitution matrix (default: data/substitution_matrix.json)\n        --gap_penalty: integer (negative for penalty) (default: -10)\n        --output_dir: directory to save outputs (default: output/)\n\n   Then, the steps in main.py:\n\n        1. Read sequences and substitution matrix.\n        2. Compute the distance matrix (using the alignment module and distance_matrix module).\n        3. Perform hierarchical clustering (clustering module).\n        4. Plot the dendrogram (visualization module) and save to output_dir.\n        5. Also, save the linkage matrix? and the cluster assignments at a given threshold? \n\n   But the user wants to be able to calculate clusters for different thresholds. So we can:\n\n        - Save the linkage result (from step 3) and then provide a function that, given a threshold, returns the clusters.\n\n   We can design an interactive part? Or we can have the main script take a threshold as an argument? \n\n   Let\'s have:\n\n        --threshold: (optional) if provided, then output the clusters at that threshold and save to a file.\n\n   If not provided, we just build the tree and plot the dendrogram.\n\n   We can also have a mode where the user can input a threshold later? But the requirement is to be able to calculate clusters for different thresholds.\n\n   We can save the linkage matrix and then have a separate script or function to compute clusters for a given threshold.\n\n   We\'ll design the clustering module to have:\n\n        - A function that takes a distance matrix and returns the linkage matrix.\n        - A function that takes the linkage matrix and a threshold and returns the clusters (flat clusters).\n\n   Then, we can write a separate script for clustering at a threshold? or we can extend main.py to accept a threshold.\n\n   We\'ll extend main.py to accept:\n\n        --threshold: if provided, compute clusters and save to a file.\n\n   So:\n\n        main.py without --threshold: only dendrogram.\n        with --threshold: dendrogram and clusters.\n\n   We\'ll also design so that the user can run the clustering step independently? We can save the distance matrix and linkage matrix to files.\n\n   But for now, we\'ll do:\n\n        main.py: \n          - computes the distance matrix (which is expensive) and the linkage matrix.\n          - saves the distance matrix and linkage matrix to output_dir for future use.\n\n   Then, we can have a separate script, say `cluster_at_threshold.py`, that loads the linkage matrix and a threshold, and outputs the clusters.\n\n   However, to keep it simple, we\'ll do everything in main.py for now.\n\n   We\'ll write the distance matrix and linkage matrix to disk so we don\'t have to recompute.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        if output_dir/distance_matrix.npy exists and output_dir/linkage.npy exists, then load them.\n        else, compute and save.\n\n   But we must check if the input data or parameters have changed. We can use a hash of the input sequences and parameters to check.\n\n   Alternatively, we can force recompute with a flag. For simplicity, we\'ll skip caching for now and let the user manage.\n\n   Given time, we can add caching later.\n\n   For now, we\'ll compute every time.\n\n   We\'ll structure the code to be modular so we can add caching easily.\n\n   We\'ll create a function in distance_matrix.py:\n\n        def compute_distance_matrix(sequences, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty):\n            # returns a 2D numpy array, and also a list of species names (to remember the order)\n\n   In clustering.py:\n\n        def compute_linkage(distance_matrix, method=\'average\'):   # method can be chosen? default average.\n            # returns linkage matrix\n\n        def get_clusters(linkage_matrix, threshold):\n            # returns an array of cluster assignments\n\n   In visualization.py:\n\n        def plot_dendrogram(linkage_matrix, labels, output_path):\n            # plots and saves to output_path\n\n   In main.py:\n\n        Steps:\n          args = parse_args()\n          sequences = read_json(args.sequences)   # returns dict: species -> sequence\n          substitution_matrix = read_json(args.matrix)\n\n          # Create a list of species and their sequences in fixed order\n          species = list(sequences.keys())\n          seqs = [sequences[s] for s in species]\n\n          distance_matrix = compute_distance_matrix(seqs, substitution_matrix, args.gap_penalty)\n\n          linkage_matrix = compute_linkage(distance_matrix)\n\n          plot_dendrogram(linkage_matrix, species, os.path.join(args.output_dir, \'dendrogram.png\'))\n\n          if args.threshold:\n              clusters = get_clusters(linkage_matrix, args.threshold)\n              # Save clusters: for each species, which cluster it belongs to.\n              with open(os.path.join(args.output_dir, f\'clusters_threshold_{args.threshold}.txt\'), \'w\') as f:\n                  for s, c in zip(species, clusters):\n                      f.write(f"{s}\\t{c}\\n")\n\n   We must note: the distance matrix must be in a condensed form? or square form? \n\n   The `scipy` linkage function expects a condensed distance matrix (upper triangle as a flat array) or a square matrix.\n\n   We have a square matrix? Yes, we compute a full distance matrix.\n\n   We can pass the full square matrix and `linkage` will convert it to condensed if needed? \n\n   From the documentation: \n        "y : ndarray\n            A condensed or redundant distance matrix. A condensed distance matrix is a flat array containing the upper triangular of the distance matrix. This is the form that pdist returns. Alternatively, a collection of m observation vectors in n dimensions may be passed as an m by n array."\n\n   But we have a square matrix. So we can use:\n\n        from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform\n        condensed = squareform(distance_matrix)\n\n   However, the linkage function also accepts square matrices? \n\n   Let me check: the documentation says for the first parameter:\n        "y : ndarray\n            A condensed distance matrix. A condensed distance matrix is a flat array containing the upper triangular of the distance matrix. This is the form that pdist returns. Alternatively, a collection of m observation vectors in n dimensions may be passed as an m by n array."\n\n   So if we pass a square matrix, it will treat it as m vectors in n dimensions? That is not what we want.\n\n   We have two options:\n\n        Option 1: Convert the square distance matrix to condensed form (using squareform: note that squareform can convert both ways).\n        Option 2: Use the function that accepts the square matrix? But the linkage function does not accept square form? \n\n   Actually, the linkage function only accepts condensed form. \n\n   So we must do:\n\n        condensed_dist = distance.squareform(distance_matrix)\n\n   But note: our distance_matrix is symmetric. We only need the upper triangle.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the condensed form directly when building the distance matrix? \n\n   However, we have to build the full matrix anyway? because we need the distance for every pair? \n\n   We can build the condensed form by only computing the upper triangle. But then we lose the full matrix? \n\n   We\'ll build the full matrix and then convert to condensed.\n\n   Steps for distance matrix:\n\n        n = len(seqs)\n        dist_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                score = needleman_wunsch(seqs[i], seqs[j], substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n                dist = -score   # because we are using negative of alignment score as distance\n                dist_matrix[i, j] = dist\n                dist_matrix[j, i] = dist   # symmetric\n\n        Then, to get the condensed form for linkage: we can do\n\n        condensed = dist_matrix[np.triu_indices(n, k=1)]\n\n   But note: the linkage function expects the condensed form to be the same as `pdist` returns, which is row-major order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        condensed = squareform(dist_matrix, checks=False)\n\n   Then, we pass `condensed` to `linkage`.\n\n   However, the linkage function also has an option to compute the linkage from the raw data vectors? but we don\'t have vectors, we have a distance matrix.\n\n   So we do:\n\n        from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage\n        Z = linkage(condensed, method=\'average\')\n\n   But note: the documentation says for the first argument: "condensed distance matrix Y". So we are good.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid building the full matrix and build the condensed form directly? \n\n        condensed = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                score = needleman_wunsch(seqs[i], seqs[j], ...)\n                dist = -score\n                condensed.append(dist)\n\n        Then we have the condensed form.\n\n   This is more memory efficient? But the full matrix is only O(n^2) and n is the number of species (which might be in the order of hundreds? thousands?).\n\n   We\'ll assume the number of species is not huge (like <=1000). So building the full matrix is acceptable.\n\n   But note: the alignment is O(n*m) per pair, and'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 718, 'total_tokens': 4814, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 512}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 512, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 206}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'a5706d59-7cb6-40b0-a675-a576530a3cb2', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--577ac23a-d6f1-4b7d-90e3-5ff4486abff3-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 718, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 4814, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 512}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are given two input files:\n  1. `organisms.json`: A JSON file mapping species names (strings) to their amino acid sequences (strings).\n  2. `blosumXX.json` (where XX is either 50 or 62): A JSON file representing the BLOSUM substitution matrix. The keys are either:\n        - Single characters (representing the cost of deleting that amino acid)\n        - Two concatenated characters (representing the cost of substituting the first by the second, or vice versa? Note: the example includes both "ab" and "ba", but in the example they are the same. However, the problem states that the key is two concatenated characters and the value is the substitution cost. We must note that the substitution cost from amino acid X to Y is the same as Y to X? The example shows both "ab" and "ba" with the same cost. But in reality, BLOSUM matrices are symmetric. So we can assume that for a pair (X, Y), the key is the sorted concatenation? Or the order doesn\'t matter? Actually, the example file structure shows both "ab" and "ba", but it\'s possible that the matrix is stored with both orders? However, that would be redundant. Alternatively, the problem might be that the example is just illustrative and in practice we will have only one of them? But the example shows both.\n\nHowever, note the example: \n    { "a": -1, "b": -2, "ab": -3, "ba": -3, "aa": 2, "bb": 3 }\n\nThis example includes both "ab" and "ba". But in a real BLOSUM matrix, we would expect the cost for substituting \'a\' with \'b\' to be the same as substituting \'b\' with \'a\'. So the matrix is symmetric. However, the file includes both keys? That seems redundant. \n\nBut wait: the problem says: "a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other". It doesn\'t specify the order. So we must be able to look up the substitution cost for (X, Y) by trying both "XY" and "YX"? Or is the matrix stored in a normalized order (e.g., sorted alphabetically)? \n\nAlternatively, the example might be just illustrating that the keys are two letters and that both orders are present? But in reality, we might have only one of them? \n\nWe must clarify: the problem says the key is two concatenated characters. It does not specify the order. Therefore, to be safe, we should design the code to try both orders? Or we can assume that the matrix is stored with the keys in a consistent order? \n\nHowever, the problem states: "Example above says that: deleting \'a\' cost -1; deleting \'b\' cost -2; swapping \'a\' for \'b\' or \'b\' for \'a\' cost -3". So the example uses both keys "ab" and "ba" to represent the same cost? That is redundant. \n\nBut note: the example file structure is just an example. The actual BLOSUM matrices we will use (blosum50.json and blosum62.json) might be structured differently? \n\nWe need to ask: How are the two-character keys stored in the actual BLOSUM files? Are they stored in both orders? Or only one? And if only one, which order?\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify. Therefore, we must design the code to be flexible. We can do:\n\n  For a substitution between amino acid `a` and `b`:\n      Try the key `a+b` (i.e., string of a and b in that order) and if not found, try `b+a`.\n\nBut note: the example file has both "ab" and "ba". So we can also assume that the file will have both? Then we can use either? \n\nAlternatively, we can preprocess the BLOSUM dictionary to create a new dictionary that maps a frozenset of two characters to the score? But wait, what if the matrix has different scores for "ab" and "ba"? The example does not. And the problem says that the key "ab" represents the cost of substituting one for the other, without specifying direction. So we assume symmetric.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  For two amino acids `x` and `y`:\n      key1 = x + y\n      key2 = y + x\n      if key1 in blosum_dict:\n          score = blosum_dict[key1]\n      elif key2 in blosum_dict:\n          score = blosum_dict[key2]\n      else:\n          # This should not happen if the matrix is complete? But we must handle.\n          # We could use a default? Or raise an error? The problem doesn\'t specify.\n\nBut note: the example also includes single letter keys for deletion.\n\nWe are also told that during one run, only one BLOSUM matrix will be used, but we might switch between runs (so the code should be able to load either blosum50 or blosum62).\n\nThe task: calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score for aligning two sequences for many pairs of species.\n\nWe note that we are not required to output the alignment, only the score.\n\nWe will need to:\n  1. Read the organisms.json and load it into a dictionary: species -> sequence.\n  2. Read the BLOSUM matrix file (either blosum50.json or blosum62.json) into a dictionary.\n  3. For every pair of species (or at least for the pairs we are interested in? The problem doesn\'t specify if we need all pairs or a subset. But for building a phylogenetic tree, we typically need a distance matrix for all pairs), we will compute the alignment score.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says "for many pair of species". We will assume we need to compute for every unique pair? \n\nBut note: the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm returns a global alignment score. We will use the BLOSUM matrix for substitution and the gap penalties? Wait, the problem does not specify gap penalties. \n\nIn the classic Needleman-Wunsch, we have:\n   - A substitution matrix (which we have from BLOSUM)\n   - A gap opening penalty (and sometimes a gap extension penalty, but the classic uses linear gap penalty)\n\nBut the problem does not specify the gap penalty. We must clarify.\n\nLooking back: the example BLOSUM file includes single letter keys for deletion. How are these used? \n\nIn the classic formulation, we have:\n   S(i,j) = max {\n        S(i-1, j-1) + subst_score(seq1[i], seq2[j]),\n        S(i-1, j) + gap_penalty,\n        S(i, j-1) + gap_penalty\n   }\n\nBut the gap_penalty is a constant? And the problem doesn\'t specify what it should be.\n\nHowever, note that the BLOSUM file includes deletion costs for single amino acids. This is unusual because in the standard Needleman-Wunsch, the gap penalty is the same for every amino acid. \n\nBut the problem says: "a single character key represents the cost of deleting that character". So we have a gap penalty that is amino acid specific? \n\nThat is not standard. Typically, the gap penalty is a constant. \n\nThis leads to ambiguity. We have two possibilities:\n\n  Possibility 1: The gap penalty is constant, and the single-letter keys are not used for gaps? Then why are they there? \n\n  Possibility 2: The gap penalty is the cost of deleting a specific amino acid, so when we introduce a gap in sequence1 (which means we are skipping an amino acid in sequence1, i.e., deleting it from sequence1) we use the deletion cost for that amino acid. Similarly, for a gap in sequence2, we use the deletion cost for the amino acid in sequence2? \n\nBut wait, the gap is introduced in one sequence, meaning we are aligning an amino acid in one sequence with a gap. The gap is not an amino acid. So how can we assign a deletion cost per amino acid? \n\nAlternatively, the deletion cost for an amino acid might be used when we have a gap in the other sequence? For example, when we have a gap in sequence2 at a position where sequence1 has amino acid `a`, then we use the deletion cost for `a`? \n\nThis is a common variant: using position-specific gap penalties? But the problem doesn\'t specify.\n\nGiven the description, I think we must use:\n\n   - When we have a gap in sequence1 (meaning we are aligning a gap with amino acid `a` in sequence2), then we use the deletion cost for `a` (from the BLOSUM matrix, key = "a").\n   - Similarly, when we have a gap in sequence2 (aligning a gap with amino acid `a` in sequence1), then we use the deletion cost for `a`.\n\nSo the gap penalty is not constant, but depends on the amino acid that is being "deleted" (i.e., the one that is aligned with the gap).\n\nTherefore, in the recurrence:\n\n   Let `seq1` and `seq2` be the two sequences.\n   Let `d1(i)` = deletion cost for the amino acid at position i in seq1? But wait, no: when we have a gap in sequence1, we are at a position in sequence2. Actually, the deletion cost is for the amino acid that is present in the sequence where there is no gap? \n\nSpecifically:\n\n   - For a gap in sequence1 (so we are at position j in seq2, and we have a gap in seq1): penalty = blosum_dict[seq2[j]]  (the single letter key for the amino acid in seq2 at that position)\n   - For a gap in sequence2 (so we are at position i in seq1): penalty = blosum_dict[seq1[i]]\n\nBut note: the example shows negative values for deletion (which are penalties, so negative means cost). So we add a negative number to the score, which reduces the score.\n\nThis is a key point.\n\nSo the recurrence:\n\n   Let `s1 = seq1`, `s2 = seq2`, and let `m = len(s1)`, `n = len(s2)`.\n\n   We create a DP table `dp` of size (m+1) x (n+1).\n\n   Base conditions:\n      dp[0][0] = 0\n      dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + blosum_dict[s1[i-1]]   for i from 1 to m   [because we are deleting the first i amino acids of s1, each deletion cost for s1[i-1]]\n      dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + blosum_dict[s2[j-1]]   for j from 1 to n\n\n   Then for i from 1 to m, and j from 1 to n:\n\n        match = dp[i-1][j-1] + substitution_score(s1[i-1], s2[j-1])\n        delete_in_s1 = dp[i][j-1] + blosum_dict[s2[j-1]]   # because we are aligning a gap in s1 with s2[j-1] -> use deletion cost for s2[j-1]\n        delete_in_s2 = dp[i-1][j] + blosum_dict[s1[i-1]]   # because we are aligning s1[i-1] with a gap -> use deletion cost for s1[i-1]\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(match, delete_in_s1, delete_in_s2)\n\n   Then the alignment score is dp[m][n].\n\nBut note: the substitution_score function: we have two amino acids a and b. We look in the BLOSUM dictionary for the key a+b and then b+a? As discussed.\n\nHowever, note: the BLOSUM matrix is for substitution. The value for a substitution of a and b is the same as b and a? So we can also create a helper function:\n\n   def get_substitution_score(a, b, blosum_dict):\n        key1 = a + b\n        key2 = b + a\n        if key1 in blosum_dict:\n            return blosum_dict[key1]\n        elif key2 in blosum_dict:\n            return blosum_dict[key2]\n        else:\n            # If not found, what to do? We could use a default? But the matrix should have all combinations.\n            # We might raise an error or use a very low score? The problem doesn\'t specify.\n            # We\'ll use a fallback: maybe the minimum value in the matrix? But we don\'t have the whole matrix in memory in the function.\n            # Alternatively, we could preprocess the matrix to create a dictionary that maps (min(a,b), max(a,b)) to the score? \n            # But let\'s do that in a preprocessing step when we load the BLOSUM matrix.\n\nAlternatively, we can preprocess the BLOSUM dictionary to a new dictionary that uses a canonical key (e.g., tuple of sorted letters) for substitution? Then we can avoid the lookup by two keys.\n\nBut note: the BLOSUM matrix might have both keys? And they might be the same? So we can do:\n\n   We\'ll create a new dictionary for substitutions that is keyed by (a, b) for every pair we have? But that would be memory heavy? And we don\'t know the order.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute a dictionary that maps a frozenset([a, b]) to the score? But wait, if a==b, then we have one key. But if a != b, then we have one key. However, the problem is that the original dictionary has two keys for the same pair? So we can pick one? But we don\'t know which one is present? \n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the file might have both keys, we can do:\n\n   When loading the BLOSUM dictionary, we can create a substitution dictionary that uses a canonical key: for two distinct letters, we use the tuple (min(a,b), max(a,b)). For same letters, we use (a, a). Then we can store the substitution score for that canonical key.\n\nBut note: the BLOSUM file also has single letter keys. So we should separate the substitution scores from the deletion scores.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   deletion_scores = {}\n   substitution_scores = {}\n\n   for key, value in blosum_data.items():\n        if len(key) == 1:\n            deletion_scores[key] = value\n        elif len(key) == 2:\n            # create canonical representation: (min, max) for two distinct, or (a,a) for same.\n            a, b = key[0], key[1]\n            if a == b:\n                canonical = (a, b)\n            else:\n                canonical = (min(a, b), max(a, b))\n            # But note: what if we have both "ab" and "ba"? Then we might get two entries for the same canonical pair? We can check? Or just overwrite? \n            # Since they are the same, we can use the first one we see? Or we can check for consistency? \n            # For now, we\'ll assume they are the same and if we see two different values for the same canonical pair, we\'ll take the last? But that might be an error.\n            substitution_scores[canonical] = value\n\n   But wait, the example has both "ab" and "ba" and they are the same. So we can also do: we don\'t need to store both. We can store one.\n\n   Then in the alignment, for two amino acids a and b:\n        if a == b:\n            key = (a, a)\n        else:\n            key = (min(a, b), max(a, b))\n        score = substitution_scores.get(key, None)\n\n   If None, then we have a problem.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid preprocessing and just do the two-key lookup in the original dictionary? That might be simpler and more memory efficient? We are going to do a lot of lookups? The sequences can be long, and we have O(n*m) per pair, and then O(n^2) pairs? So we must be efficient.\n\nBut the two-key lookup per substitution would be two dictionary lookups per substitution. That is acceptable? \n\nBut note: the dictionary lookup is O(1). So two lookups per substitution is acceptable? It\'s constant time. \n\nSo we can do without the preprocessing? But we also have the deletion scores. We will use the deletion scores as described.\n\nTherefore, we will:\n\n   - Use the original blosum_dict for deletion: for an amino acid `a`, we use `blosum_dict[a]` (if present) for the gap penalty when `a` is aligned with a gap.\n   - For substitution, we try `a+b` and then `b+a` in the original blosum_dict.\n\nBut what if neither is present? We should handle that.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   def get_score(blosum_dict, a, b=None):\n        if b is None:\n            # deletion score for a\n            return blosum_dict.get(a, None)   # but we must have it? \n        else:\n            key1 = a + b\n            if key1 in blosum_dict:\n                return blosum_dict[key1]\n            key2 = b + a\n            if key2 in blosum_dict:\n                return blosum_dict[key2]\n            return None\n\n   Then if we get None, we can use a default? But what default? The problem doesn\'t say. We can use a very low score? Or raise an error? \n\nGiven that the BLOSUM matrix should cover all standard amino acids, we can assume that we have all necessary keys? But we must be safe.\n\nWe\'ll decide: if we get None for a deletion, we will use a default gap penalty? But the problem does not specify. We must ask the user? \n\nAlternatively, we can set a default gap penalty? But the problem states that we are using the provided BLOSUM matrix. So we should not have missing keys? \n\nSo we will assume that the BLOSUM matrix is complete? Then we can raise an exception if we don\'t find a key? That would help debugging.\n\nSo:\n\n   if we get None for a deletion, we raise KeyError(f"Deletion cost for amino acid {a} not found in BLOSUM dictionary")\n   Similarly, for substitution, we raise KeyError(f"Substitution cost for {a} and {b} not found")\n\nBut note: the sequences might have non-standard amino acids? The problem doesn\'t specify. We\'ll assume they are standard.\n\nSummary of the task:\n\n  Steps:\n    1. Load the organisms.json -> dict: species to sequence.\n    2. Load the blosumXX.json -> dict: keys are either 1-char (deletion) or 2-char (substitution).\n    3. For every pair of species (we\'ll need to compute the score for every unique unordered pair?

## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to create a Python script for the first task: calculating Needleman-Wunsch scores for all pairs of species from an input file, using a given BLOSUM matrix.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the organisms from `organisms.json` and the BLOSUM matrix from `blosumXX.json`.\n 2. Preprocess the BLOSUM matrix: \n    - We have two types of keys: single characters (for deletion cost) and two characters (for substitution cost). Note that the two-character keys are not ordered? Actually, in the example we have both "ab" and "ba", which are the same cost. But note: in the example, both "ab" and "ba" are present and have the same value. However, in a typical BLOSUM matrix, the cost for substituting a with b is the same as b with a. So we can assume symmetry? But the problem states: a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one for the other. And the example includes both "ab" and "ba". However, the example has the same value for both. We\'ll assume that the matrix is symmetric and that both keys are present? But to be safe, we should design the code so that we look for the key as the two characters in the order they appear in the alignment step? Actually, in the Needleman-Wunsch, we are comparing two characters: one from sequence1 and one from sequence2. So we can form a key by concatenating the two characters. But note: the example file has both "ab" and "ba". So we have to be cautious.\n\n    However, note: the example says:\n        "ab": -3, "ba": -3\n\n    So if we are aligning two characters (let\'s say char1 from seq1 and char2 from seq2), we can form the key by just `char1 + char2`. But what if the matrix doesn\'t have that key? We might need to try the reverse? But the problem states that the key is two concatenated characters. And the example includes both orders. So we must have both? Or maybe the matrix is stored with both? Actually, the example file structure includes both.\n\n    But to be safe, we should design the code so that we only use the key formed by the two characters in the order: first the character from the first sequence, then the character from the second sequence.\n\n    However, the problem says: "a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other". It doesn\'t specify order. But the example has both. So we can assume that the matrix includes both? Or maybe the matrix is symmetric and we can use either? But the problem does not guarantee symmetry? Actually, BLOSUM matrices are symmetric. So we can assume that the value for `char1+char2` is the same as `char2+char1`. However, the file might not have both. So we must design:\n\n        If we have a key for `char1+char2`, use it.\n        Else, try `char2+char1`? But the problem says the key is two concatenated characters. And the example has both. So we should require that the matrix has the key in the order we form? \n\n    Since the problem states that the key is two concatenated characters, and we are aligning two characters (char1 from seq1, char2 from seq2), we will form the key as `char1 + char2`. And we expect that key to be in the matrix.\n\n    However, note: the example includes both. So we can assume that the matrix is complete? But to be safe, we can check and throw an error if the key is missing.\n\n 3. Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm:\n    - We are only required to compute the score (not the alignment).\n    - We are given:\n        gap_penalty: actually, the gap penalty is given by the deletion cost for the character? But note: the deletion cost in the matrix is for a single character. However, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm uses a gap penalty that is constant? Or linear? The problem says: "deleting that character" meaning that the cost for a gap of one character is the value for that single character? But wait, in the example, the deletion cost for \'a\' is -1. So if we have a gap in sequence1 and the character in sequence2 is \'a\', then the cost is -1? Actually, the deletion cost is for deleting a character, which corresponds to introducing a gap. However, in the Needleman-Wunsch, we usually have a gap penalty that is the same regardless of the character? But here it is character specific? \n\n    Let me re-read: "a single character key represents the cost of deleting that character". So when we delete a character (say \'a\') we get a penalty of -1. But note: in the alignment, if we have a gap in one sequence, we are effectively deleting a character from the other sequence? Actually, in the standard Needleman-Wunsch, we have two sequences and we can have a gap in either. The problem does not specify whether the deletion cost is for the character in the first sequence or the second. \n\n    However, the problem states: "deleting that character". So if we have two sequences, and we are at a position where we have a character in sequence1 and a gap in sequence2, then we are deleting the character in sequence1? Similarly, if we have a gap in sequence1 and a character in sequence2, we are deleting the character in sequence2? But note: the matrix has a deletion cost for each character. So we can use:\n\n        For a gap in sequence2 (so we are aligning char1 from seq1 with a gap): penalty = blosum[char1] (the deletion cost for char1)\n        Similarly, for a gap in sequence1: penalty = blosum[char2]\n\n    However, the example does not specify if the deletion cost is the same regardless of which sequence the gap is in? But the deletion cost is defined per character. So we can use the same cost for a gap in either sequence? That is, if we have a gap in sequence2 and the current character in sequence1 is \'a\', then we use the deletion cost for \'a\'. Similarly, if we have a gap in sequence1 and the current character in sequence2 is \'a\', we use the same deletion cost for \'a\'.\n\n    But note: the example matrix does not have a deletion cost for every character? Actually, the example only has \'a\' and \'b\'. We assume that the matrix includes deletion costs for every amino acid that appears in the sequences.\n\n 4. Algorithm for Needleman-Wunsch (only score):\n    We\'ll create a 2D DP table of size (len(seq1)+1) x (len(seq2)+1).\n    Initialization:\n        dp[0][0] = 0\n        for i in range(1, len(seq1)+1):\n            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + blosum[seq1[i-1]]   # because we are deleting each character in seq1 to align with the gap in seq2\n        for j in range(1, len(seq2)+1):\n            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + blosum[seq2[j-1]]   # deleting each character in seq2\n\n    Then, for i from 1 to len(seq1) and j from 1 to len(seq2):\n        match_score = blosum[seq1[i-1] + seq2[j-1]]   # substitution cost for aligning seq1[i-1] with seq2[j-1]\n        dp[i][j] = max(\n            dp[i-1][j-1] + match_score,\n            dp[i-1][j] + blosum[seq1[i-1]],   # gap in seq2: we are deleting seq1[i-1]\n            dp[i][j-1] + blosum[seq2[j-1]]    # gap in seq1: we are deleting seq2[j-1]\n        )\n\n    The final score is dp[len(seq1)][len(seq2)]\n\n 5. We must compute the score for every pair of species. We are going to store the scores in a structure that allows fast access. We can use a dictionary of dictionaries: \n        scores[species1][species2] = score\n\n    But note: the matrix is symmetric? The algorithm is symmetric? Actually, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is symmetric? But note: the gap penalty is character specific. If we have two sequences and we swap them, the gap penalties for the same character would be the same? But the alignment might not be symmetric? Actually, the problem does not specify that the substitution matrix is symmetric? But the example has symmetric substitution (ab and ba same). And BLOSUM is symmetric. However, the deletion cost is per character and independent of the sequence. So the score for (seq1, seq2) should be the same as (seq2, seq1)? \n\n    We can compute only the upper triangle? But the problem doesn\'t require that. We\'ll compute all pairs.\n\n 6. We are given an example test case: \n        species1: "testspecies1" with sequence "aabaab"\n        species2: "testspecies2" with sequence "ababaa"\n        blosum.json: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}\n\n    Expected score: 7.\n\n    We\'ll test our algorithm with this example.\n\n 7. We are to write the code in multiple files for modularity. We\'ll create:\n        nw.py: contains the function for Needleman-Wunsch score calculation and a helper to load the BLOSUM matrix and organisms.\n        main.py: the main script that reads the input files, computes the scores for all pairs, and stores the result in a suitable structure.\n\n 8. We are required to use integer scores and no decimal points.\n\n 9. We\'ll assume the BLOSUM matrix file is provided and the organisms file is in the current directory.\n\n 10. We\'ll create a function that computes the NW score for two sequences and a given BLOSUM dictionary.\n\n 11. We\'ll be cautious about performance because we are going to compute O(n^2) pairs and each alignment is O(n*m). The sequences might be long? We are not told the length. But we assume that we have to do it anyway.\n\n 12. We\'ll structure the code so that we can reuse the BLOSUM matrix (load once) and the sequences (load once).\n\n Files:\n\n    nw.py:\n        Functions:\n            load_blosum(file_path): returns a dictionary of the BLOSUM matrix.\n            load_organisms(file_path): returns a dictionary of species to sequence.\n            nw_score(seq1, seq2, blosum_dict): returns the integer score.\n\n    main.py:\n        Steps:\n            - Parse command line arguments? Or we can hardcode the filenames? The problem says: \n                  We have two input files: "organisms.json" and "blosumXX.json"\n            - The problem says: "In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score ... for many pairs of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used"\n\n            So we can take the BLOSUM filename as an argument? Or we can let the user change the filename? The problem doesn\'t specify. Since the project is evolving, we can make the BLOSUM file name configurable. We can pass it as a command line argument? But the problem does not specify. We can hardcode the filenames? \n\n            However, the problem says: "blosumXX.json", where XX is either 50 or 62. So we can let the user specify the BLOSUM matrix via an environment variable or command line? But the problem does not specify. Since it\'s the first task, we can design the main script to take two command line arguments: the organisms file and the BLOSUM file.\n\n            Alternatively, we can have a configuration? But to keep it simple, we\'ll use command line arguments.\n\n        Command line arguments:\n            -o or --organisms: path to organisms.json (default: \'organisms.json\')\n            -b or --blosum: path to blosumXX.json (default: \'blosum50.json\')? But we don\'t know. We can require the user to specify.\n\n        We\'ll design:\n            $ python main.py -o organisms.json -b blosum50.json\n\n        Then, we\'ll compute the scores for every pair and store the result in a variable (dictionary of dictionaries) and then we can save it? The problem says: "These scores will be later used for other algorithms". So we should save the scores to a file? But the problem doesn\'t specify. We are only required to compute and store in a structure for fast access. For now, we can output the scores to a JSON file? Or we can just keep in memory and then in the next task we can use it? Since this is part of a larger project, we\'ll design to output the scores to a file so that the next step can read it.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify an output for this task. But the instruction says: "I will divide my inputs into descriptions of the task, and requests for code generation". And this task is only to calculate the scores. So we\'ll store the scores in a file so that we can use it later.\n\n        We\'ll output a JSON file: \n            { \n              "species1": {\n                  "species2": score12,\n                  "species3": score13,\n                  ...\n              },\n              "species2": {\n                  "species1": score21,   # which is the same as score12? But we computed both? Actually, we can compute both? But note: the algorithm is symmetric? Actually, the NW algorithm with symmetric substitution matrix and same gap penalty per character is symmetric? So we can compute only once? But the problem does not require symmetry. So we\'ll compute both.\n\n              }\n            }\n\n        But note: the example does not require symmetry? Actually, the NW algorithm we implemented is symmetric? Because:\n            nw_score(seq1, seq2, blosum) = nw_score(seq2, seq1, blosum)\n\n        Why? \n            The substitution cost for (a,b) is the same as (b,a) because the blosum dictionary has the same value for both keys? Actually, we are using the key `a+b` for (a,b) and `b+a` for (b,a). But the example blosum has both keys and they are the same. But what if the matrix is not symmetric? Then the scores might be different? The problem does not say the matrix is symmetric. However, the example is symmetric.\n\n        We\'ll compute both directions? Actually, we are iterating over all pairs: for species1 in species, for species2 in species. So we will compute (species1, species2) and (species2, species1). But if the algorithm is symmetric, then we can avoid double computation. However, we are not sure. So we\'ll do both.\n\n        But note: the NW algorithm we described above is not symmetric if the gap penalty is character specific? Actually, if we have:\n            In the forward: \n                gap in seq2: penalty = blosum[char1]\n                gap in seq1: penalty = blosum[char2]\n            In the reverse (seq2 and seq1 swapped):\n                gap in seq2 (which is now the original seq1): penalty = blosum[char2] (for a gap in the new seq2) -> but note: in the reverse, when we have a gap in the new seq1 (which is the original seq2) we use blosum[char1]? \n\n        Actually, the gap penalty is applied based on the character that is present. So the penalty for a gap in the first sequence (when the second sequence has a character c) is blosum[c]. Similarly, in the reverse alignment, when we have a gap in the first sequence (which is now the original second sequence) and the second sequence (original first) has a character d, we use blosum[d]. \n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is symmetric only if the gap penalties are symmetric? But the gap penalty is defined per character and independent of the sequence. So the same character has the same gap penalty regardless of which sequence it is in. Therefore, the score for (seq1, seq2) should equal the score for (seq2, seq1). \n\n        We can compute only one triangle? But to keep the code simple and because the problem does not specify the number of species, we\'ll compute both. If the sequences are long and the number of species is large, we might want to optimize. But we are not told the size.\n\n        We\'ll output the entire matrix (all pairs) in a JSON file.\n\n        Output file: we can name it "nw_scores.json"\n\n 13. Let\'s code accordingly.\n\n 14.

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are given two input files: `organisms.json` and `blosumXX.json` (where XX is 50 or 62).\n Steps:\n 1. Read the `organisms.json` file to get a dictionary of species names to amino acid sequences.\n 2. Read the `blosumXX.json` file to get the substitution and gap penalties.\n 3. For every pair of species (including the same species? yes, but note: same species will be aligned to itself, which is fine) we will compute the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score.\n 4. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm:\n    - We have two sequences: seq1 (length m) and seq2 (length n).\n    - We create a DP table of size (m+1) x (n+1).\n    - Initialization:\n        dp[0][0] = 0\n        for i from 1 to m: dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + gap_penalty(seq1[i-1])   [gap in second sequence]\n        for j from 1 to n: dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + gap_penalty(seq2[j-1])   [gap in first sequence]\n    - For cell (i, j) (with i from 1 to m, j from 1 to n):\n        match_score = dp[i-1][j-1] + substitution_score(seq1[i-1], seq2[j-1])\n        gap1 = dp[i-1][j] + gap_penalty(seq1[i-1])   # gap in second sequence (so we take gap cost for the amino acid in seq1)\n        gap2 = dp[i][j-1] + gap_penalty(seq2[j-1])   # gap in first sequence\n        dp[i][j] = max(match_score, gap1, gap2)\n\n    However, note the BLOSUM file structure:\n        - The gap penalty for an amino acid \'x\' is given by the key "x" (a single character).\n        - The substitution score for aligning amino acid \'x\' with \'y\' is given by the key "xy" (two characters).\n\n 5. We must store the scores for every pair in a dictionary (for fast access later) and also save the results to a JSON file.\n\n Additional requirement from the second instruction:\n   - Save the scores in a JSON file named "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json", where XX comes from the input BLOSUM file.\n   - The key for each pair is the concatenation of the two species names with an underscore: e.g., "Wild boar_Horse".\n   - The value is the integer score.\n\n Note: The example test case: \n        species1: "aabaab", species2: "ababaa", BLOSUM: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}\n        Expected score: 7.\n\n We\'ll design the code in a modular way:\n\n File structure:\n   - main.py: the main script that orchestrates the reading, computation, and saving.\n   - nw_align.py: a module containing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm implementation.\n\n We\'ll create functions:\n\n In nw_align.py:\n   - def nw_score(seq1, seq2, blosum_dict):\n        This function returns the Needleman-Wunsch score for two sequences using the provided BLOSUM dictionary.\n\n In main.py:\n   - Read the organisms.json and blosumXX.json.\n   - For each pair of species (including every combination), compute the score and store in a dictionary with key "species1_species2".\n   - Save the dictionary to a JSON file.\n\n However, note: the problem says "for each pair of species", meaning every unordered pair? But the key in the output is by concatenating the names, and we have two orders? \n But note: the example output file key is "Wild boar_Horse", which is one way. However, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is symmetric? Actually, it is symmetric only if the substitution matrix is symmetric and the gap penalties are the same for the same amino acids? \n But note: the BLOSUM matrix is symmetric? In the example, "ab" and "ba" are the same? In the example they are both -3. However, in the BLOSUM matrix, the score for (a, b) is the same as (b, a). So we can assume symmetry.\n\n But the algorithm we implemented above does not assume symmetry? Actually, the gap penalty for a particular amino acid is the same regardless of which sequence it is in. So the algorithm is symmetric? \n However, note: the gap penalty for an amino acid \'x\' is the same in both sequences? Yes, because the BLOSUM dictionary gives a gap penalty for an amino acid regardless of which sequence it is in.\n\n Therefore, the score for (seq1, seq2) should be the same as (seq2, seq1). But we are going to compute both? The problem says "for each pair", meaning every unordered pair? Actually, in the example output key, it is "Wild boar_Horse", which is one string. We don\'t have both "Wild boar_Horse" and "Horse_Wild boar".\n\n We need to clarify: the problem says "concatenating names of the species in the pair". It doesn\'t specify order. But the example key is "Wild boar_Horse". We\'ll assume that we are to generate one key per unordered pair? Actually, the problem doesn\'t say unordered. It says "for each pair", which in programming often means every ordered pair? But note: the Needleman-Wunsch score for (A, B) is the same as (B, A) because of symmetry. And the example output file only has one entry per unordered pair? Actually, the problem does not specify.\n\n However, the instruction says: "keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using \'_\'", and it doesn\'t specify the order. But we have to choose an order. We can choose to always write the first species (as in the dictionary) and then the second? But the dictionary is unordered (in Python, we read as dict, but we can sort the keys?).\n\n But note: the problem says "for each pair of species", meaning every distinct pair? And the example output file has one entry per pair? \n\n Let\'s re-read: the instruction says "for each pair of species from organism.json". We have to compute for every pair, meaning every two distinct species? Actually, it doesn\'t say distinct? But we have to compute for the same species too? Because the same species aligned to itself might be the highest score.\n\n Since the problem doesn\'t specify, we will compute for every ordered pair? But that would be n^2 entries. However, note that the example output key is "testspecies1_testspecies2", which is one key. And the problem says "the pair", which might imply unordered? But the example doesn\'t have both orders.\n\n But note: the Needleman-Wunsch score is symmetric? Yes, because the substitution matrix is symmetric and the gap penalty for an amino acid is the same regardless of the sequence. So we can compute only one of (A, B) and (B, A) and they are the same. \n\n However, the problem does not specify if we should have both orders. The output key is a concatenation of the two names. We can choose an order: for example, we can sort the two species names alphabetically? But the example key is "Wild boar_Horse", which is not sorted (Horse comes before Wild boar alphabetically?).\n\n Alternatively, we can do as the example: the first species as it appears in the input? But the input dictionary is unordered. We can decide to output the keys in the order of the species names as they appear in the input dictionary? But that might be arbitrary.\n\n Let\'s stick to the following: we will compute for every unordered pair (each distinct pair of species) and also for the same species? Yes, same species is a pair too? The problem says "each pair", which in biology might include self? \n\n But note: the problem says "for each pair of species", which typically means two distinct species? However, the example test case uses two distinct species. But the same species might be needed? For the phylogenetic tree, we need the distance between a species and itself? \n\n Actually, the Needleman-Wunsch score for the same species is the maximum possible for that sequence? But we are going to have a score for (A, A) which is the alignment of the sequence with itself. That is useful? \n\n In the context of a distance matrix for a phylogenetic tree, we often need a matrix that is symmetric and has zeros on the diagonal? But here we are computing similarity, not distance. We can convert to distance later? \n\n Since the problem does not specify, we will compute for every ordered pair? That is, for species A and B, we will have two keys: "A_B" and "B_A"? But that would be redundant because the score is the same. And also, we have "A_A", "B_B", etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute only one triangle? But the problem says "for each pair", which in natural language often means unordered. However, the example output key is "testspecies1_testspecies2", which is one key.\n\n We\'ll do it as follows: we will compute for every unordered pair (each distinct combination without considering order) and also for the same species? Actually, the same species is one species, not a pair? But the problem says "pair of species", which might imply two? We\'ll compute for every two species: meaning for every (i, j) with i and j in the list of species (i can be equal to j). \n\n However, the problem does not specify if we need the same species. But in the example test case, we are given two distinct species. \n\n Since the problem says "for each pair", and in the context of building a distance matrix for a phylogenetic tree, we need a matrix that includes the diagonal (same species) and both triangles? Actually, the distance matrix is symmetric and the diagonal is the distance to itself (which is zero). But we are computing similarity? \n\n How will we use the scores? We are going to build a phylogenetic tree. The tree building algorithms (like UPGMA or neighbor-joining) require a distance matrix. So we might need to convert the similarity to distance? But that is not specified in this step.\n\n Since the requirement is to compute the Needleman-Wunsch score for each pair, we will compute for every pair (i, j) for i, j in the list of species. That is, we include the same species and both orders? But note: the score for (i, j) is the same as (j, i). So we can store one entry per unordered pair? But the problem says the key is concatenated with an underscore. We can choose to always store the key in a canonical order: sort the two species names? Then we avoid duplicates.\n\n However, the example key is "Wild boar_Horse", which is not sorted. So we must follow the order as given? The problem does not specify the order. We can do:\n\n   key = f"{species1}_{species2}"\n\n for every ordered pair? Then we would have two entries for two different orders? But that would be redundant. And the problem says "the pair", which is unordered.\n\n We have to clarify: the problem says "concatenating names of the species in the pair". It does not specify order. So we can choose a convention: we will output both orders? Or only one? \n\n But note: the example output file has one key: "testspecies1_testspecies2". So we are going to have one key per unordered pair? Actually, no: because the example key is not symmetric: it is "testspecies1_testspecies2", which is one specific order.\n\n How about we do: for every pair (i, j) with i and j in the species, and we output the key as i_j. We will do this for every i and j (so including same species and both orders). Then we will have n^2 entries. \n\n But note: the example input has two species: Wild boar and Horse. Then we would have:\n   "Wild boar_Wild boar"\n   "Wild boar_Horse"\n   "Horse_Wild boar"\n   "Horse_Horse"\n\n However, the problem says "for each pair of species", which might be interpreted as distinct species? And the example output key is only one? \n\n We must go back to the problem: "for each pair of species from organism.json". The word "pair" in combinatorics can be ordered or unordered. But in common language, when we say "pair", we often don\'t consider the same element? \n\n However, the example test case: two distinct species. \n\n To avoid confusion, we will follow the example: the example output file has one key: "testspecies1_testspecies2". And the problem says "the pair", meaning one entry per unordered pair? But then why not have both orders? \n\n Since the Needleman-Wunsch score is symmetric, we can compute only one. We will compute for every unordered pair (i, j) with i != j, and also for i=j? The problem doesn\'t specify same species. \n\n But note: the problem says "at the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds". The clustering might require a distance between a species and itself? \n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, we will compute for every ordered pair (i, j) for all i and j. This will produce a full matrix. Then in the output JSON, we have keys for every ordered pair. \n\n But note: the example test case: \n        species: testspecies1 and testspecies2 -> we would have two keys: "testspecies1_testspecies2" and "testspecies2_testspecies1", both with the same score? \n\n However, the example expected output is one score. The problem does not specify that we should avoid duplicates. \n\n We\'ll do as the problem says: the key is created by concatenating the names in the pair with an underscore. So for the pair (testspecies1, testspecies2) we have the key "testspecies1_testspecies2". For (testspecies2, testspecies1) we have "testspecies2_testspecies1". \n\n But that would be two entries for the same pair? And they have the same score? \n\n We have two choices: \n   1. Only compute for i <= j? Then we avoid duplicates? But then we have only one key per unordered pair? \n   2. Compute for every ordered pair and then we have two keys for the same pair? \n\n The problem does not specify. But the example output file only has one key? \n\n Looking at the example: the expected output of the example test case is 7, and the key is "testspecies1_testspecies2". So we are only required to compute one ordered pair? \n\n How about we let the user decide? Actually, the problem says "for each pair of species", meaning every two species? And the order is not specified. \n\n Since the problem is ambiguous, and the example only shows one key, and the example key is "testspecies1_testspecies2", we will assume that we are to compute only one direction? But which direction? \n\n We note that the example key is "testspecies1_testspecies2", which is the first species and then the second. \n\n We will compute for every ordered pair (i, j) for i and j in the species. That is, we will have an entry for every ordered pair. \n\n However, the problem says "the pair", which might be unordered? But the key is built by concatenating in a specific order. \n\n Since the problem does not specify the order, we will use the order of the keys in the input dictionary? But the input dictionary is unordered. We can sort the species names? \n\n We decide: we will iterate over the species in sorted order? Then for species i and j, we will create two keys: if i < j (alphabetically) then we do i_j and j_i? Actually, we are iterating over every ordered pair.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   for species1 in species_list:\n        for species2 in species_list:\n            key = f"{species1}_{species2}"\n            compute score and store\n\n Then we have n^2 entries.\n\n But the example test case: two species, so 4 entries? But the example output only has one? \n\n The example output file is for the example test case? The example test case only has one pair? But the example test case says: \n        one string for "testspecies1", one for "testspecies2", and the output of the algorithm should be 7.\n\n And the example output file would have at least two entries: \n        "testspecies1_testspecies1": score for same species\n        "testspecies1_testspecies2": 7\n        "testspecies2_testspecies1": 7   (because symmetric)\n        "testspecies2_testspecies2": score for same species\n\n But the problem says "the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7" for the pair (testspecies1, testspecies2). It doesn\'t say anything about the same species.\n\n So we are going to generate 4 entries for two species? \n\n The problem does not specify which pairs to compute. We will compute all ordered pairs.\n\n But note: the problem says "for each pair of species", meaning every two species? And in the context of a distance matrix, we need the full matrix? \n\n So we do: we compute a full matrix (n x n) and store it in a dictionary with keys of the form "species1_species2".\n\n Steps in main.py:\n\n   import json\n   import os\n   from nw_align import nw_score\n\n   # Read the organisms.json\n   with open(\'organisms.json\', \'r\') as f:\n       organisms = json.load(f)\n\n   # Read the BLOSUM file (the name is provided by the user?

Or we can have it as a configuration? \n\n   Since the problem does not specify, we can hardcode the BLOSUM filename? But the requirement is to be able to change between runs. So we should take the BLOSUM filename as an input? \n\n   How about we read the BLOSUM filename from the command line? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem says "I will be using pyenv to create the environment and pip to install packages", but doesn\'t specify how the program'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 1752, 'total_tokens': 5848, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 1536}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 1536, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 216}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'b4b1a7ff-5a79-4db8-870d-a87a799c03a5', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--0c7b28a4-cb48-498b-af1b-c285723e8729-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1752, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 5848, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 1536}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to build a phylogenetic tree using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach (bottom-up) based on similarity scores (Needleman-Wunsch scores) that we computed in the previous step.\n\n Important points:\n 1. We are working with similarity scores (higher = more similar) and not distances (lower = closer). \n 2. We will use single linkage, which for similarity would mean that the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any pair of elements (one from each cluster). However, note that in the context of building a phylogenetic tree, we are going to merge the two species (or clusters) that have the highest similarity at each step.\n\n Steps for hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) using similarity:\n   - Start with each species as its own cluster.\n   - At each step, find the two clusters that have the highest similarity (maximal similarity score) and merge them.\n   - We will create a new cluster that represents the ancestor of the two merged clusters. The new cluster will be represented by a node in the tree.\n\n 3. We need to update the similarity matrix after each merge. Since we are using single linkage, the similarity between the new cluster and any other cluster is the maximum similarity between any element in the new cluster and any element in the other cluster.\n\n 4. We must record the tree structure so that we can later output it in Newick format and also for drawing a dendrogram.\n\n 5. We are going to store the tree in a structure that can be used for:\n      - Writing in Newick format.\n      - Cutting the tree at different thresholds to form clusters.\n\n 6. The thresholds for clustering will be chosen from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores. Since the tree is built by merging clusters at decreasing similarity levels (as we go up the tree), the threshold will be applied from the root down: we will cut the tree at a given similarity threshold, meaning that any node (or edge) that has a similarity value below (or above? note: we are using similarity) the threshold will form separate clusters.\n\n    However, note: in the tree building process, when we merge two clusters, the similarity at which they merge is the similarity that we used to choose them. As we go up, the similarity at which clusters merge decreases. Therefore, to form clusters for a given threshold T, we would consider all merges that occurred at a similarity >= T as part of the same cluster. In other words, we stop merging when the similarity drops below T, so the clusters present at that point are the clusters for threshold T.\n\n 7. We must design the tree structure so that we can:\n      - Record the merging events (with the similarity score at which the merge happened).\n      - Record the leaves (species) and the hierarchical structure.\n\n 8. We are going to represent the tree as a binary tree. Each node will have:\n      - left and right children (if internal node)\n      - or a leaf (if leaf node)\n      - the similarity score at which the node was created (for internal nodes, this is the similarity of the two merged clusters at the time of merging; for leaves, we can set the similarity to a base value? Actually, leaves don\'t have a merging event, so we only record the similarity for internal nodes)\n\n 9. The Newick format for a tree: \n        - For a leaf: the name of the species.\n        - For an internal node: (left_subtree, right_subtree):label \n        - But note: we also want to record the branch lengths? The problem doesn\'t specify that. We are only given similarity scores. \n        - The problem says: "draw a dendrogram representing this tree". The dendrogram typically shows the similarity (or distance) at which merges occur. In Newick format, we can put the similarity at which the merge happened as the branch length? Actually, the problem doesn\'t specify the branch length. It only says to draw a dendrogram and save in Newick format.\n\n    We have two options for Newick format:\n        Option 1: Without branch lengths: (A,(B,C));\n        Option 2: With branch lengths: (A:0.1,(B:0.2,C:0.3):0.15);\n\n    However, the requirement for later tasks (clustering) does not require branch lengths. The clustering is based on the threshold of similarity, which is the value at the node (the merge height). \n\n    But note: the dendrogram drawing libraries (like scipy) use the merge heights. So we can represent the tree without branch lengths? Actually, the Newick format we output should be compatible with dendrogram drawing and also for clustering.\n\n    Since the problem does not specify, we will output the tree without branch lengths. However, we can store the similarity of the merge event at the internal node. But the Newick format standard doesn\'t require that. \n\n    We can represent the tree in Newick format by including the merge height (similarity) as a label for the internal node? Or as branch length? \n\n    Let me clarify: In the dendrogram, the vertical axis is the similarity (or distance). So when we draw, we need the similarity at which the merge occurred. \n\n    How about we do:\n\n        For a leaf node: the species name (e.g., "Horse")\n        For an internal node: (left, right):sim_value\n\n    But note: the Newick format does not require a label. We can also set the branch length to be the difference in the similarity from the parent? \n\n    Actually, the common practice in phylogenetics is to have branch lengths represent evolutionary distance (or time). We don\'t have that. We have the similarity at the merge event. \n\n    Alternatively, we can set the height of the node (the y-axis in the dendrogram) as the similarity. But the Newick format doesn\'t store the height of the node, it stores the branch lengths. \n\n    We have to decide how to represent the tree. Since the problem says "draw a dendrogram", we can use a library that takes a linkage matrix (like the one from scipy.cluster.hierarchy) and then we can use the dendrogram function. \n\n    However, note: we are building the tree from similarity and not distance. And scipy uses distance. So we have two options:\n\n        Option A: Convert our similarity to distance. Since similarity is higher for closer species, we can do: distance = max_similarity - similarity. Then use the distance matrix for clustering.\n\n        Option B: Implement our own hierarchical clustering algorithm that works on similarity and then build the tree structure.\n\n    Considering the requirement that we must use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores and that later steps will use the tree built with these scores, we have to be cautious.\n\n    But note: the problem says "it is extremely important to come up with a solution that operates on similarity scores". Therefore, we cannot convert to distance and use standard libraries that require distance? Actually, we can convert the similarity to a distance by: distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or (similarity_max - similarity) to make sure that the closest points have the smallest distance. However, the problem says that the later steps assume raw scores. \n\n    How about we build the tree ourselves? This way we have full control and can store the raw similarity at each merge.\n\n    Steps for building the tree:\n\n        We have a matrix S of similarity scores for every pair of species.\n\n        Initialize:\n            - Each species is a cluster.\n            - The current set of clusters: [cluster1, cluster2, ...] where each cluster initially contains one species and has an id and the set of species it contains.\n\n        We need a data structure to store the tree. We can create a node class:\n\n            class Node:\n                def __init__(self, id, species=None, left=None, right=None, similarity=None):\n                    self.id = id   # a unique id for the node (for internal nodes we can assign negative or increasing integers, leaves are the species names? or we can use an integer id for leaves too and map to species name)\n                    self.species = species   # if leaf, the species name; else None\n                    self.left = left\n                    self.right = right\n                    self.similarity = similarity   # the similarity at which this node was created (for leaves, we don\'t have similarity, so set to None? or for leaves we can set similarity to a very high value? Actually, we don\'t use the leaf similarity in the tree building. The internal nodes record the similarity of the merge.\n\n        However, note: the clustering algorithm doesn\'t require the tree structure until the end. We can record the merges and then build the tree at the end.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a linkage matrix style as in scipy but with similarities. \n\n        Let me think about the algorithm:\n\n            clusters = [ [species_i] for each species_i ]\n            trees = [ Node(species_i) for each species_i ]   # each tree is a leaf node\n\n            current_similarity_matrix = the initial matrix S (for the species)\n\n            next_cluster_id = len(species)   # we start assigning new ids from n (number of species) upwards.\n\n            while there is more than one cluster:\n                Find the pair of clusters (i, j) with the highest similarity in current_similarity_matrix.\n\n                Let sim = current_similarity_matrix[i][j]\n\n                Merge cluster i and cluster j into a new cluster: new_cluster = cluster_i + cluster_j (the union)\n\n                Create a new internal node:\n                    new_node = Node(id=next_cluster_id, left=tree_i, right=tree_j, similarity=sim)\n\n                Remove clusters i and j and add new_cluster.\n\n                Update the similarity matrix for the new cluster: \n                    For every other cluster k, the similarity between new_cluster and k is:\n                         sim(new_cluster, k) = max( sim(x, y) for x in new_cluster, y in k )   # single linkage\n\n                But note: we don\'t have the similarity between every two species in the new_cluster and k? Actually, we have precomputed the similarity for every pair of species? But we don\'t have the similarity between a species and a cluster? \n\n                However, because we are using single linkage and we have the full matrix of species-species similarities, we can compute the similarity between two clusters as the maximum similarity between any species in cluster1 and any species in cluster2.\n\n                But we don\'t need to compute from the original species? We can use the precomputed species-species similarities? Yes, because we never computed cluster-cluster beyond the species level? Actually, we can store the entire similarity matrix for species, and then for clusters, we can compute the similarity between two clusters by:\n                    sim(cluster1, cluster2) = max{ S(s1, s2) for s1 in cluster1, s2 in cluster2 }\n\n                However, this is O(|cluster1|*|cluster2|) for each pair. We can optimize by keeping for each cluster the set of species it contains, and then compute the similarity between two clusters by iterating over the species in them.\n\n                But note: the number of clusters is decreasing, and the clusters are getting larger. The total complexity might be O(n^3) in the worst case, which is acceptable for a moderate number of species (n up to a few hundred). If we have thousands, we might need a better method.\n\n            However, the problem doesn\'t specify the number of species. We should design for moderate sizes (n<=1000) but if the data is huge, we might need a different approach.\n\n        Given that we are in a bioinformatics context and the Needleman-Wunsch is O(n^2) per pair and we did that for all pairs (which is O(n^2 * len(seq1)*len(seq2))), that step is already expensive. So we assume that the number of species is not too large (maybe tens or hundreds). \n\n        So we can proceed with the above.\n\n        We will maintain:\n            - clusters: a list of clusters, each cluster is a set (or list) of species names (or the original keys from the organism.json)\n            - trees: a list of root nodes for each cluster (so we can build the tree)\n            - current_similarity: a dictionary of dictionaries? Or a 2D array? But the clusters are changing.\n\n        Alternatively, we can maintain a distance matrix (but we have similarity) between clusters. We can have a 2D array (or a matrix) that is updated. We index the clusters by their index in the current clusters list.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            n = len(species_list)\n            # Initialize the current similarity matrix for clusters: an n x n matrix (but we only need the upper triangle)\n            # Let M be a 2D list of size n x n, where M[i][j] = similarity between cluster i and cluster j.\n\n            Initially, M[i][j] = S(species_i, species_j) from our precomputed scores.\n\n            Then, at each step:\n                Find the indices (i, j) such that i<j and M[i][j] is the maximum.\n\n                Merge cluster i and j -> new cluster.\n\n                Remove rows and columns for i and j, and add a new row and column for the new cluster.\n\n                How to compute the similarity between the new cluster and an old cluster k?\n                    M[new][k] = max( M[i][k], M[j][k] )   ??? \n\n                But wait: the similarity between the new cluster (which is the union of cluster_i and cluster_j) and cluster_k is:\n                    max( M[x][k] for x in {i, j} and for all species in cluster_x? Actually, no. We have stored the similarity between clusters? \n\n                Actually, note: our matrix M is defined between clusters. Initially, each cluster has one species. After merging, the new cluster contains all species of i and j. Then the similarity between the new cluster and cluster k is the maximum similarity between any species in the new cluster and any species in cluster k. \n\n                However, we don\'t store the species-level similarities for every pair of species? But we do: we have the precomputed dictionary of scores for every pair of species. So we can compute:\n\n                    sim_new_k = max{ S(s1, s2) for s1 in new_cluster, s2 in cluster_k }\n\n                But note: we have the entire precomputed species-species similarity in a dictionary? Yes, because we computed the Needleman-Wunsch score for every pair of species and saved it.\n\n                So we can store a dictionary `similarity_dict` that maps a pair (species1, species2) to the score. But note: we stored the scores in a file by concatenating the species names with an underscore. We also have the in-memory structure from the first task: a dictionary that we built.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                Precomputed_sim = a dictionary: key: (species1, species2) (with species1 and species2 in alphabetical order? or we have stored the key as "species1_species2")? Actually, in the first task we stored the key as "species1_species2", but we also have the in-memory structure in the first task: a 2D structure? \n\n            We can store the precomputed scores in a 2D dictionary: `precomputed_scores[species1][species2]` = score. But note: the score is symmetric? And we don\'t care about the order? \n\n            So let\'s assume we have a function `get_species_pair_score(s1, s2)` that returns the precomputed score for the pair (s1, s2). We can build a dictionary for that from the file we saved? Or we have it from the first task? \n\n            We are going to have the scores already in memory from the first task? Yes, we computed them and then saved to a file. So in the second task, we can load the file? Or we can pass the scores from the first task? \n\n            Since the project is divided into tasks, we can design the second task to read the "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file? \n\n            But the problem says: "these scores will be later used for other algorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access". So we have the scores in a dictionary: `scores` where key is the string "species1_species2", and the value is the integer score.\n\n            However, for the tree building, we want to get the score between two species without having to remember the key format. We can create a helper function that given two species names, returns the score by creating the key: `f"{species1}_{species2}"` and then look up in the dictionary. But note: the key is symmetric? In the first task, we stored the key as "species1_species2" regardless of the order? Actually, we stored the key as `f"{org1}_{org2}"` and we did for every pair (both orders? no, we did for every unordered pair? Actually, we stored one key per unordered pair? Let me check the first task:\n\n                We stored: key = f"{org1}_{org2}" for every pair (org1, org2) and we computed the score for the pair (org1, org2). But note: the score is symmetric? Yes, because the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is symmetric? Actually, the algorithm is symmetric: the score from org1 to org2 is the same as org2 to org1? Yes.\n\n            So we can build a function:\n\n                def get_score(species1, species2, scores_dict):\n                    key1 = f"{species1}_{species2}"\n                    key2 = f"{species2}_{species1}"\n                    # But we stored only one of them? \n                    # In the first task, we stored the key as `f"{org1}_{org2}"` for the pair (org1, org2) and we did for every unordered pair? Actually, we did:\n\n                    for i, org1 in enumerate(organisms):\n                        for j in range(i+1, len(organisms)):\n                            org2 = organisms[j]\n                            key = f"{org1}_{org2}"\n\n                    So we stored only one key per unordered pair: the one with the first species being the one that comes first in the list? Actually, we did:\n\n                    The species names are taken from the keys of the organisms dictionary, and we did:\n\n                    organisms = list(organisms_dict.keys())\n\n                    and then we iterated over the list. So the order of the list is the order of the keys? We should sort the list to make sure we have consistent order? \n\n                    But in the first task, we didn\'t sort. So we stored the key as the first species in the iteration order and then the second. \n\n                    To be safe, we can do:\n\n                    key1 = f"{species1}_{species2}"\n                    key2 = f"{species2}_{species1}"\n\n                    and then try both? \n\n                    But note: we stored only one key. We stored the key in the order of the loop: we did for i, then'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 2180, 'total_tokens': 6276, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 1728}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 1728, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 452}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'ec62a3a8-0294-408f-a2ef-d759b32b49cc', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--4748f727-deeb-4d2d-b7a1-ca03e4bdec4d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2180, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 6276, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 1728}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to build a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering with single linkage, but note: we are using similarity scores (higher = more similar) instead of distance (lower = closer). \n We have the pairwise similarity scores from the previous step (stored in a dictionary or a matrix). Since most libraries (like SciPy) work with distances, we can convert similarity to distance by taking the negative (or using a transformation such as distance = max_similarity - similarity). However, note the requirement: the tree must be built using the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores because later steps (like cluster thresholding) will use the raw scores.\n\n Important: We are to build a tree where each internal node has a "height" which is the similarity score at which the two clusters were merged. Since we are merging the most similar (highest score) first, we can think of the height as the similarity score.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have a list of species (leaves) and a matrix (or dictionary) of pairwise similarity scores.\n 2. We will perform hierarchical clustering using the single linkage method. However, note that single linkage uses the minimum distance between clusters. But we are using similarity. So we can convert the similarity to a distance by:\n      distance = (max_possible_similarity - similarity)   OR   we can use: distance = -similarity\n    However, the problem is that the similarity scores are not bounded above by a fixed maximum? But note: we want the clusters to merge when the similarity is high, so the distance should be low for high similarity.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the similarity matrix directly and use the maximum similarity (which is equivalent to single linkage with similarity: we take the maximum similarity between any two elements of the two clusters) and then merge the clusters with the maximum similarity. But the standard algorithms are for distances.\n\n 3. We can use the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` module, but we have to use a custom metric? Actually, we can provide a condensed distance matrix and then use the \'single\' method. But we must convert our similarity to distance.\n\n    Let D = similarity matrix. We want to convert to a distance matrix: \n        dist = max_similarity - similarity   OR   dist = -similarity\n\n    However, using max_similarity might be problematic because we don\'t know the maximum? Actually, we can use the maximum value in the entire similarity matrix? But note: the similarity between the same species? Actually, we have the self-similarity which is the highest? Not necessarily: the Needleman-Wunsch score for two identical sequences might be high, but two different sequences might have a higher score? Actually, no: the maximum score for two sequences is when they are identical? But the matrix is fixed by the algorithm.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use: dist = -similarity. Then the two sequences with the highest similarity (say 1000) become the smallest distance (-1000). Then the single linkage will look for the two clusters with the smallest distance (i.e., the highest similarity). This is acceptable.\n\n    But note: the height of the internal node in the dendrogram is the distance at which the clusters merge. We want the height to be the similarity score. So after building the tree, we can adjust the heights by: \n        height = -distance   OR   height = max_similarity - distance?\n\n    Actually, we want the internal node to have the similarity score as the height. When we merge two clusters, the similarity score for the merge is the maximum similarity between any two elements in the two clusters (single linkage). So that is the value we want to assign as the height.\n\n    However, in the conversion we did: \n        dist = -similarity\n        then the merging distance (as reported by the algorithm) would be: d = -s, where s is the similarity at which they merge.\n\n        Then we can set the height of the node to: s = -d.\n\n    So we can do that.\n\n 4. Steps in code:\n    a. Load the precomputed similarity scores from the JSON file (we have a dictionary with keys like "Horse_Dog" and the score as integer).\n    b. Create a list of species (the leaves).\n    c. Build a condensed distance matrix for the lower triangle (as required by SciPy) by:\n          - Create a full matrix of distances (n x n) for n species, where the distance for (i, j) is: dist = -similarity(i, j)\n          - But note: the similarity of a species with itself is not stored? We have to assume we don\'t need it? Actually, we can set the diagonal to zero? But the algorithm doesn\'t need the diagonal.\n\n    d. Use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with the condensed distance matrix (using the method \'single\') and then form the tree.\n\n    e. However, the linkage matrix produced by SciPy has the distances (which we converted from similarity) as the merging distances. We want to convert these back to similarities? Actually, we can adjust the linkage matrix: for each row in the linkage matrix, the third column (the distance at which the clusters merge) is d. We want to set it to s = -d.\n\n    But wait: the linkage algorithm uses the distances we provide. We want the merging condition to be the maximum similarity (which is the minimum of our negative distance). The single linkage method uses the minimum distance between clusters, which in our case is the maximum similarity? Yes.\n\n    However, the height in the dendrogram (when we plot) should be the similarity. So we can adjust the linkage matrix by replacing the distance column (index 2) with the original similarity? Actually, we don\'t have the original similarity for the merged clusters? We only stored the pairwise similarities for the leaves.\n\n    Alternatively, we can store the similarity at the time of merging? But the linkage algorithm doesn\'t store that. We have to reconstruct the merging order and then assign the similarity? \n\n    Actually, we can avoid the conversion and then adjust the linkage matrix: since we know that the distance we passed was -similarity, then the distance in the linkage matrix is the negative of the similarity that caused the merge. So we can do:\n\n        Z = linkage(condensed_dist, method=\'single\')\n        Z[:, 2] = -Z[:, 2]   # convert the distance back to similarity\n\n    But note: the distances for the non-leaf nodes are computed by the algorithm as the minimum distance (which is the maximum similarity) between clusters. However, the value stored in the linkage matrix for the new cluster is the distance (our negative similarity) at which the clusters were merged. So by negating we get the similarity.\n\n    However, we must be cautious: the algorithm might use the distance for further merges? Actually, after we adjust the distance in the linkage matrix, we break the distance values? We don\'t want that. We want the algorithm to use the distances we provided for the leaves, and then for the clusters we use the same transformation? Actually, the linkage algorithm computes the distance between clusters based on the provided condensed matrix and the method. We cannot change the distance values until after the linkage is done.\n\n    So we can do the adjustment after the linkage? Then we have a linkage matrix that we can use to form the tree, but the heights (distances) are now converted back to similarities.\n\n    But note: the linkage matrix has the structure: [node1, node2, distance, count]. We can change the distance to similarity by negating? Yes, because we did: distance = -similarity.\n\n    So: \n        Z = linkage(condensed_dist, method=\'single\')\n        Z[:, 2] = -Z[:, 2]   # now this column is the similarity at which the merge happened.\n\n    However, we must check: if two leaves have similarity s, then the distance we passed was d = -s. The linkage will report the merge at distance d. Then we convert back to s by -d. That is correct.\n\n 5. But note: the similarity scores we have are for the leaves. The non-leaf nodes (clusters) are merged based on the maximum similarity between any two leaves in the clusters (single linkage). So the similarity for the merge is the maximum pairwise similarity between the two clusters. This is exactly what we want.\n\n 6. We are going to create a tree structure. We can use the `to_tree` method from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` to convert the linkage matrix to a tree object. Then we can traverse the tree to assign the height (which is the similarity from the linkage matrix) to each internal node.\n\n 7. However, the requirement: the intermediate node should have the Needleman-Wunsch score as its height. The tree we build will have the leaves (with no height? or height 0?) and the internal nodes with the height = similarity at merge.\n\n 8. We also need to be able to output the tree in Newick format. We can write a recursive function to do that. The Newick format for a node would be: \n        (left_child, right_child):height\n    and for a leaf: species_name:height? But note: the leaf should have a branch length from its parent? \n\n    Actually, the Newick format typically represents the branch lengths (the difference in heights). But in our case, we have the absolute height for each node? \n\n    How do we compute branch lengths? \n        For a leaf, the branch length would be: (parent_node.height - 0) ? But we didn\'t assign a height to the leaf? \n\n    Alternatively, we can store the absolute height for each node (the similarity at which the node was created). Then the branch length for a child node from its parent is: (parent.height - child.height). \n\n    But note: the root node has no parent? And the leaves have height 0? Actually, we don\'t have a natural height for the leaves. We can set the leaf height to 0? Then the branch from a leaf to its parent is (parent.height - 0) = parent.height.\n\n    For an internal node, the branch length to its parent would be (parent.height - current_node.height).\n\n    However, the problem: we are not given any height for the leaves. The Needleman-Wunsch score for a species with itself? That would be the maximum, but we don\'t have that in the pairwise scores? We only have between different species? \n\n    Actually, the tree building process: we start with each species as a cluster at height 0? Then when we merge two clusters, we set the new cluster\'s height to the similarity score at which they were merged.\n\n    So the branch length for a leaf would be (parent.height - 0) = parent.height. For an internal node that is merged at height h1 and then becomes part of a larger cluster merged at height h2 (with h2 > h1), then the branch length from the internal node to the parent is (h2 - h1).\n\n    This is acceptable.\n\n 9. Steps for the code:\n\n    We\'ll create a function that:\n        - Reads the precomputed similarity scores from the JSON file (for the given BLOSUM version, say blosum50 or blosum62).\n        - Builds a list of species (the leaves).\n        - Builds a full distance matrix (n x n) for the species, where for i != j: \n                dist[i, j] = -similarity(species_i, species_j)\n          and the diagonal is 0 (but it won\'t be used because we condense the matrix by taking the upper triangle without diagonal).\n        - Converts the full matrix to a condensed distance matrix (the vector form for the upper triangle).\n        - Performs hierarchical clustering with method=\'single\' to get the linkage matrix Z.\n        - Converts the distances in Z (the third column) back to similarity by: Z[:,2] = -Z[:,2]\n        - Then, we can build a tree object from Z (using `to_tree` from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`). The tree node will have a \'dist\' attribute? But we adjusted it to similarity? Actually, we can create a custom tree node that stores the height (the similarity) and the id (either the leaf name or an internal id).\n\n    However, the `to_tree` function returns a tree node that has:\n        - left: the left child\n        - right: the right child\n        - id: the node id (for leaves, it\'s the index in the original list; for internal nodes, it\'s an id >= n)\n        - dist: the distance (which we have adjusted to similarity) at which the node was created.\n\n    So we can use that.\n\n    Then we need to write a function to convert this tree to Newick format, but with branch lengths computed as the difference in heights (similarity) between the node and its parent? Actually, the Newick format typically uses branch lengths (differences) and not absolute heights. However, the absolute height is stored at the node? How do we compute the branch length for a node? \n\n    We can do a recursive function that:\n        - For a leaf: the branch length is (node.dist - 0) ? But wait: the leaf node in the tree object from `to_tree` has a `dist`? Actually, the leaf node has `dist=0`? \n\n    How does the `to_tree` work? The node in the tree built by `to_tree` has:\n        - If it\'s a leaf: id < n, and left and right are None, and the dist is 0? \n        - If it\'s an internal node: left and right are the children, and dist is the height (the similarity at merge) that we set.\n\n    Then the branch length for a leaf from its parent is (parent.dist - leaf.dist) = parent.dist. For an internal node (non-root) from its parent: (parent.dist - node.dist). The root has no parent? So we set the root\'s branch length to 0? Or we don\'t assign one? \n\n    Actually, the Newick format for the root is the entire tree. We can represent the tree without a root branch? \n\n    But note: the typical Newick format for a tree built by hierarchical clustering is: \n        ((A:0.1, B:0.1):0.2, C:0.3);\n\n    In this representation, the branch from the root to the internal node (A,B) is 0.2, and from the internal node to A and B is 0.1. The branch from the root to C is 0.3.\n\n    How do we assign branch lengths in our tree?\n\n        We have:\n            root: has two children (internal_node and C). The root has a height (dist) of 0.3 (if that was the last merge). The internal node (A,B) has a height of 0.1. Then:\n                branch from root to internal_node: root.dist - internal_node.dist = 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.2\n                branch from root to C: root.dist - 0? But wait, the leaf C is at height 0? Then the branch is 0.3.\n\n            Similarly, the branch from the internal_node to A: internal_node.dist - A.dist = 0.1 - 0 = 0.1.\n\n        So the rule: \n            branch_length = (parent.dist - node.dist)   [if node is not the root]\n\n        For the root, we don\'t assign a branch length? But the root is the entire tree. We can set the root branch to 0? Or we can set the root to have no branch length? \n\n        Actually, the root doesn\'t have a parent. So we don\'t assign a branch length to the root. The Newick format for the root is the entire tree without a branch length? \n\n        Example: \n            root: \n                left = internal_node (with dist=0.1)\n                right = leaf C (with dist=0.0)\n                root.dist = 0.3\n\n            Then the Newick for the root would be: \n                ( (A:0.1, B:0.1) : (0.3-0.1)=0.2 , C: (0.3-0)=0.3 ) \n\n            But wait: the root node itself is not drawn? The entire tree is: ( (A:0.1, B:0.1):0.2, C:0.3 )\n\n            However, the root node is the parent of the internal_node and leaf C. So the root node has two branches: one to the internal_node (length=0.2) and one to leaf C (length=0.3). \n\n        How do we represent that? The root node is not labeled and has no branch length? The Newick string for the root would be: \n            ( (A:0.1, B:0.1):0.2, C:0.3 )\n\n        But note: the root node is the whole tree. We don\'t assign a branch length to the root? \n\n        So in the recursive function, we don\'t assign a branch length to the root? Actually, the root is the top node. We can represent the tree as: \n            ( (A:0.1, B:0.1):0.2, C:0.3 )\n\n        This is a tree with two children: one is the subtree (A,B) and the other is C. The branch to the subtree (A,B) is 0.2 and to C is 0.3.\n\n        So the algorithm for Newick:\n\n            def to_newick(node, parent_dist=None):\n                if parent_dist is None: \n                    # root: then we don\'t add branch length to itself, but we add branch lengths to its children?\n                    # Actually, we don\'t have a parent for the root, so we only write its children.\n                    # But note: the root has two children? We write the two children with their branch lengths computed as (parent_dist - node.dist) but parent_dist is the root\'s dist? \n                    # However, the root doesn\'t have a parent, so we use the root\'s own dist to compute the branch lengths for its children? \n                    # Actually, the root\'s dist is the height at which the last merge happened. The children of the root are at height: left_child.dist and right_child.dist? Then the branch length for the children is (root.dist - child.dist).\n\n                    # But wait: the root is the last merge, so it has the highest dist (similarity). The children of the root are the two clusters that were merged at the root. So the branch length for each child is (root.dist - child.dist).\n\n                else:\n                    branch_length = parent_dist - node.dist\n\n                If node is a leaf:\n                    return f"{node.id}:{branch_length}"   # but note: the leaf node doesn\'t have a dist? Actually, we set the leaf node\'s dist to 0? Then branch_length = parent_dist - 0 = parent_dist.\n\n                Else:\n                    left_newick ='} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 2479, 'total_tokens': 6575, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2176}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2176, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 303}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '4aa8a6f2-0f1e-4701-9e48-37fc47980b4c', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--e07798b4-b90b-4ea6-8e08-430e642e1914-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2479, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 6575, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2176}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to break down the project into multiple files for modularity and clarity.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have already implemented the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and saved the scores in a JSON file.\n 2. Now, we are building a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) with single linkage, but note: \n    - We are using similarity (higher is better) rather than distance (lower is better). \n    - We will convert similarity to distance appropriately. Since higher similarity means closer, we can use:\n        distance = (max_similarity - similarity) for each pair? But note: in single linkage, we need to define a distance metric.\n    However, the problem states: we are to merge the most similar (highest score) first. So we can treat the similarity as a measure that we want to maximize.\n\n    How to convert similarity to distance? \n      One common way: distance = max_similarity - similarity. But note: what is max_similarity? \n      Alternatively, we can use the negative of the similarity? \n\n    But note: the clustering algorithm in scipy expects a distance matrix (dissimilarity). So we can define:\n        distance_matrix = max_value_in_similarity_matrix - similarity_matrix\n    However, the problem says: we are to merge the two with the highest similarity first. That is equivalent to merging the two with the smallest distance (if we define distance as above).\n\n    Alternatively, we can use: distance_matrix = -similarity_matrix. Then the highest similarity (most positive) becomes the most negative distance, which would be the smallest distance? \n    But then the algorithm would pick the smallest distance (which is the most negative) and that corresponds to the highest similarity.\n\n    However, note: the algorithm in scipy\'s linkage function requires a distance matrix. We can use:\n\n        dist_matrix = -sim_matrix   OR\n        dist_matrix = max_sim - sim_matrix\n\n    But the problem says: the height of the internal node should be the Needleman-Wunsch score (the similarity score). \n\n    How do we assign the height? In the linkage matrix, the third column is the distance between the merged clusters. We want that to be the similarity score? \n    Actually, the problem says: the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (the similarity score). \n\n    However, in the dendrogram, the height of the node is the distance at which the clusters are merged. But we are using the similarity as the measure for merging. \n\n    We have two options:\n      Option 1: Use the similarity as the measure and invert it to get a distance for the clustering algorithm, but then when building the tree, we want the node height to be the similarity (so we have to store that separately).\n      Option 2: We can run the clustering using the similarity as the measure by defining a custom distance metric? But the standard algorithms work on distances.\n\n    Let me clarify: \n      We want to merge the two clusters that have the highest similarity. \n      We can define a distance = (max_similarity + 1) - similarity, so that the highest similarity becomes the smallest distance. Then the linkage will merge the smallest distance first.\n\n    But then the height in the dendrogram (the distance at which the clusters are merged) would be this distance. However, we want the height to be the original similarity score.\n\n    How can we do that?\n      We can store the similarity score for each merge and then use that to build the tree with the desired heights.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the `linkage` function with the option to return the entire linkage matrix, and then we can adjust the distances in the linkage matrix to represent the similarity? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: the height of the intermediate node (the new node) is the Needleman-Wunsch score of the two merged species. So for two leaves, that is the similarity score of the pair. For two clusters, we are using single linkage, so the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any pair of elements in the two clusters. And that maximum similarity becomes the height of the new node.\n\n    How do we do that? \n        We can use the `linkage` function with the method=\'single\' and input the distance matrix (which we set as: distance = max_sim - similarity). Then the height of the node (the distance at which the merge occurs) will be: max_sim - (the maximum similarity in that cluster). But we want the height to be the maximum similarity, not the distance.\n\n    So after building the linkage matrix, we can convert the distances in the linkage matrix back to similarities by: \n        height_similarity = max_sim - distance\n\n    However, note: the distance we used was: d = max_sim - s. So s = max_sim - d.\n\n    Therefore, we can:\n        Step 1: Let max_sim be the maximum value in the similarity matrix (or we can use a value that is higher than the max? Actually, we don\'t need to, because we can set max_sim = np.max(sim_matrix)).\n        Step 2: Create a distance matrix: dist_matrix = max_sim - sim_matrix\n        Step 3: Run the linkage with dist_matrix and method=\'single\'\n        Step 4: Then, to get the tree with the similarity as the height, we can adjust the linkage matrix: \n                Z[:,2] = max_sim - Z[:,2]   ??? \n\n    But note: the linkage matrix Z has four columns: \n        [idx1, idx2, distance, count]\n\n    We want the third column (the distance at which the merge occurred) to be the similarity, not the distance. So we can do:\n\n        Z[:,2] = max_sim - Z[:,2]\n\n    However, let\'s think: \n        Initially, the smallest distance (which corresponds to the highest similarity) is merged first. The distance stored in Z for that merge is the distance (d = max_sim - s). \n        Then when we do: max_sim - d = s, so we get the original similarity.\n\n    But note: when we merge two clusters, the distance stored in Z is the distance between the two clusters (which in single linkage is the minimum distance between any two points in the clusters). And that minimum distance corresponds to the maximum similarity between any two points? \n        Yes: because d = max_sim - s, so the smallest d corresponds to the largest s.\n\n    So the above conversion would set the height of the node to the similarity (the original s) that caused the merge.\n\n    However, what about the next merges? \n        The next merge will be the next smallest distance (which is the next highest similarity). And the distance stored in Z for that merge is the distance between the two clusters (which is the minimum distance between any two points in the two clusters). When we convert: we get the maximum similarity between any two points in the two clusters.\n\n    So that matches the single linkage with similarity.\n\n    Therefore, we can:\n        - Create a distance matrix: dist_matrix = max_sim - sim_matrix\n        - Use scipy\'s linkage with method=\'single\' to get Z\n        - Then set Z[:,2] = max_sim - Z[:,2]   to get the heights as the similarity.\n\n    But note: the dendrogram function in scipy expects the linkage matrix to have distances, not similarities. So if we want to plot the dendrogram, we might have to adjust? \n\n    Alternatively, we can leave the linkage matrix in terms of distances and then when we want to plot, we can set the labels appropriately? \n\n    However, the problem says: we must save the Newick format with the distances (which are the branch lengths) and also without. And in the Newick format with distances, we are to use integers without decimal points.\n\n    Important: the Newick format with distances should have the branch lengths as the differences in the heights? \n\n    But note: the linkage matrix we built (Z) has the height for each node. The branch length from a node to its child is the difference between the node\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\n    So we can build a tree (using e.g., `to_tree` from scipy) and then traverse to assign branch lengths as the difference in heights.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the `to_tree` method to get a tree structure and then write a recursive function to output the Newick string with branch lengths.\n\n    Steps for building the tree:\n\n        1. Read the precomputed similarity scores from the JSON file (for the given BLOSUM version).\n        2. Create a list of species names (the leaves).\n        3. Create a similarity matrix (symmetric) for the species. The diagonal is not used, but we can set it to max_sim? or leave as 0? Doesn\'t matter because we don\'t use diagonal.\n        4. Let max_sim = np.max(similarity_matrix)  [but note: the similarity matrix might have zeros? Actually, the scores can be negative? So we cannot assume non-negative. Then what?]\n\n    Let me reconsider: \n        We are using the Needleman-Wunsch scores. They can be negative? Yes, because the BLOSUM matrix can have negative values.\n\n    Then max_sim might not be the maximum over the entire matrix? We need to shift the matrix to non-negative? \n\n    Alternatively, we can use: \n        dist_matrix = -sim_matrix   (so that higher similarity becomes more negative, meaning a smaller distance? But then the distance would be negative? That is not allowed.\n\n    We must have non-negative distances. \n\n    How about: \n        dist_matrix = max_sim - sim_matrix   but if sim_matrix has negative values, then max_sim - sim_matrix might be very large. And we want the distances to be non-negative.\n\n    We can set: \n        max_sim = np.max(sim_matrix)\n        min_sim = np.min(sim_matrix)\n        Then we can shift: \n            dist_matrix = max_sim - sim_matrix   -> this will be non-negative? \n            Because the smallest sim is min_sim, then max_sim - min_sim >= 0, so all entries in dist_matrix are non-negative.\n\n    But note: the problem says that the height of the node is the similarity score. So we want to store the original similarity, not the shifted one.\n\n    However, when we convert the linkage matrix back: \n        Z[:,2] = max_sim - Z_dist   (where Z_dist is the distance in the linkage matrix) -> this gives the original similarity? \n        But wait: initially, we set dist_matrix = max_sim - sim_matrix. Then the linkage algorithm computes the single linkage distance between clusters as the minimum dist_matrix[i,j] for i in cluster1, j in cluster2. \n        Then Z_dist for a merge is that minimum. \n        Then when we do: max_sim - Z_dist, we get: max_sim - (min_{i,j} (max_sim - sim_ij)) = max_sim - (max_sim - max_{i,j} sim_ij) = max_{i,j} sim_ij.\n\n        So the height we set is the maximum similarity between any two points in the two clusters. That is the single linkage with similarity.\n\n    So it works.\n\n    Steps for the code:\n\n        Step 1: Read the precomputed scores from the JSON file (for the given BLOSUM version, e.g., blosum50 or blosum62).\n        Step 2: Build a list of species names (the leaves).\n        Step 3: Build a symmetric matrix of similarities (size n x n) for these species. The matrix should have the similarity for (i, j) at position (i, j). Note: the JSON file has keys like "Horse_Wild boar", so we need to match the order.\n\n        Step 4: Compute the distance matrix: \n            max_sim = np.max(similarity_matrix)   # This is the maximum similarity in the entire matrix\n            dist_matrix = max_sim - similarity_matrix\n\n        Step 5: Use scipy\'s linkage to create the linkage matrix with method=\'single\':\n            from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage\n            Z = linkage(dist_matrix, method=\'single\')\n\n        Step 6: Convert the distances in Z (the third column) back to similarities:\n            Z[:,2] = max_sim - Z[:,2]\n\n        Step 7: Now we have a linkage matrix that has the similarity as the merge height. We can use this to build a tree.\n\n        Step 8: We want to create a tree structure that we can traverse to output Newick format. We can use `to_tree` from scipy.\n\n        Step 9: The `to_tree` function in scipy (from scipy.cluster.hierarchy) returns a tree node. We can then write a recursive function to output the Newick string.\n\n        However, note: the linkage matrix we have (Z) is now in terms of similarities. But the `to_tree` function expects the third column to be the distance (the height). We have set the height to the similarity. That is okay because we are going to use the same value for the node height.\n\n        But for the Newick format with branch lengths: \n            The branch length from a node to its child is the difference between the node\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\n        Example: \n            Leaf A: height = 0? Actually, leaves are at height 0? But in our case, the leaves don\'t have a similarity score by themselves. They are merged at the similarity score of the pair.\n\n        How do we assign the height of a leaf? \n            We can set the leaf height to 0. Then the branch length from a parent to a leaf is the parent\'s height (the similarity score at which the leaf was merged) minus 0 = the parent\'s height.\n\n        But wait: the parent\'s height is the similarity score of the leaf with another leaf? Then the branch length from the parent to the leaf would be that similarity score? That doesn\'t seem right.\n\n        Actually, the tree is built by merging two leaves at a node with height = similarity_score. Then the branch length for each leaf should be the height of the parent node? \n\n        However, in the standard representation, the branch length is the difference in heights. So if the leaf is at height 0 and the parent at height s, then the branch length is s - 0 = s.\n\n        But then when we have a merge of two clusters, the branch lengths from the new parent to the two children would be the difference between the new parent\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\n        Example: \n            Merge A and B at height s1 -> node AB (height s1). Then merge AB and C at height s2 (s2 < s1? because we are merging from the bottom up). Then the branch from AB to the new root (ABC) is s2 - s1? \n\n        But note: we are merging from the most similar (highest score) to the least. So the heights (similarity) are decreasing as we go up? \n\n        Actually, the most similar pairs have the highest score. Then the next merge (with a lower similarity) is higher in the tree. So the root will have the smallest similarity.\n\n        Therefore, the height of the root is the lowest similarity. \n\n        Then the branch length from the root to the node AB would be: root_height - AB_height. But that would be negative? \n\n        We want non-negative branch lengths? \n\n        How can we represent the tree? \n\n        We can flip the heights? \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the height of a node as the "depth" from the leaves? But the problem says: the height of the node for the merge of A and B is the similarity score (1200). \n\n        So we cannot change that.\n\n        How about we set the branch length between a parent and child as: \n            parent_height - child_height   (if the parent is above the child, and parent_height < child_height, then this would be negative) -> not acceptable.\n\n        We need positive branch lengths. \n\n        Therefore, we can define the branch lengths as the difference in the inverse of the similarity? \n\n        But the problem says: the distances in the Newick format should be integers without decimal points. And the example uses positive integers.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the branch length from a node to its parent as: \n            child.branch_length = node_height - child.node_height   [but this is negative if node_height < child.node_height]\n\n        We can use: \n            branch_length = child.node_height - node_height   (if the child is a leaf, then child.node_height = 0? so branch_length = 0 - node_height = negative) -> still negative.\n\n        What if we set the leaf node_height to the maximum similarity? Then the branch length from leaf to its parent would be: parent.node_height - leaf.node_height = s1 - max_sim (negative) -> not good.\n\n        Another idea: \n            Instead of using the similarity as the node height, use the difference from the maximum similarity? \n            Let the height of the node be: max_sim - similarity. Then the leaf nodes would be at height = max_sim (if we set them to max_sim) and then the merge node for A and B would be at height = max_sim - s1. Then the branch length from A to the parent AB would be: (max_sim - s1) - max_sim = -s1 -> negative.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set the leaf nodes to 0, and the merge node AB to: max_sim - s1. Then the branch length from A to AB is: (max_sim - s1) - 0 = max_sim - s1. This is positive? But we want to represent the similarity in the branch? \n\n        The problem says: the example Newick string: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" meaning the branch from the root to the internal node (C,D) is 5, and from that node to C is 3 and to D is 4? \n\n        Actually, the standard is: \n            (A:distance_from_A_to_parent, B:distance_from_B_to_parent, ...)\n\n        How do we assign the branch lengths? \n\n        We can define the entire tree as having the root at 0 and then the branch lengths are the decreases in similarity? \n\n        Specifically, the branch length from a node to its parent is: \n            (node_height - parent_height)   [if we define the root at height=0 and the leaves at high similarity] but then the branch length would be positive? \n\n        Example:\n            Leaves: A, B, C, D.\n            Merge A and B at similarity s1 (so node AB has height s1). Merge C and D at similarity s2 (node CD has height s2). Merge AB and CD at similarity s3 (root, height s3).\n            Now, if we set the root at height s3 (which is the smallest) and then the branch from root to AB: AB is at height s1 (which is greater than s3)'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 2724, 'total_tokens': 6820, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2432}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2432, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 292}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '69b157d9-6c67-4575-b35a-276114490e33', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--3217eb66-1d06-41e5-ae1d-6effa6916ef4-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2724, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 6820, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2432}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 10

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for drawing a dendrogram of created tree.
Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are now at the point of generating code for the entire project. We have already covered:\n1. Calculating Needleman-Wunsch scores for all pairs and saving to a JSON file.\n2. Building a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) with single linkage, but note: we are using similarity (higher is better) and most libraries use distance (lower is better). So we need to convert similarity to distance appropriately.\n3. Saving the tree in Newick format (both with and without branch distances).\n4. Drawing a dendrogram and saving it as a PNG.\n\nWe have to consider that:\n- We are using two different BLOSUM matrices (50 or 62) and the output files should reflect which one was used.\n- The project structure should be modular and production-ready.\n\nWe will structure the code into multiple files for clarity. Let\'s outline the modules:\n\nFile Structure:\n1. `align.py`: Contains the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and functions for reading the BLOSUM matrix and organisms.\n2. `tree_builder.py`: Contains the hierarchical clustering (using similarity) and tree building.\n3. `newick.py`: Contains functions to convert the tree to Newick format (with and without distances).\n4. `dendrogram.py`: Contains the function to draw the dendrogram.\n5. `main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the entire process.\n\nWe have already generated code for the first part (align.py) and now we are adding the tree building, Newick export, and dendrogram drawing.\n\nImportant: \n- We must convert similarity to distance because clustering algorithms typically minimize distance. One way is to use: distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or (max_similarity + 1 - similarity) to ensure non-negative. However, note that the dendrogram must be drawn with the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores as the x-coordinate? Actually, the instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". But note: in the dendrogram, the horizontal axis usually represents the distance (or similarity) at which clusters merge. Since we built the tree using similarity (with higher meaning closer) but the dendrogram typically uses distance (with longer branches meaning more divergence), we have to be cautious.\n\nClarification from the instruction: \n   "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances"\n\nBut note: the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores are similarities (higher is better). So for the dendrogram, we want to represent the similarity as the horizontal axis? Actually, in a dendrogram, the horizontal axis is usually the dissimilarity (or distance). However, the instruction says "raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". But in our context, we have been using the term "score" for similarity. \n\nLooking back at the previous instruction: \n   "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances"\n\nBut note: we have been using the term "similarity score". So it\'s a bit ambiguous. However, the example in the drawing task says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". \n\nLet me re-read the project description: \n   "In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. ... we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar)."\n\nAnd for the dendrogram: \n   "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances"\n\nBut note: we have the raw scores (similarities) and we built the tree by merging the most similar (highest score) first. In the tree, the internal nodes have a "height" which is the similarity score at which they merged. \n\nHowever, in a typical dendrogram, the horizontal bar is drawn at a height that corresponds to the distance (or dissimilarity) at which the clusters merge. Therefore, we have two options:\n\nOption 1: Use the similarity score as the horizontal position and interpret it as "the higher the similarity, the closer to the left". But that would be unconventional because in dendrograms the branches that are longer (to the right) represent greater divergence.\n\nOption 2: Convert the similarity to a distance. We can define: distance = max_score - similarity, where max_score is the maximum possible score? But note: we don\'t have a fixed max_score. Alternatively, we can use: distance = (max_observed_similarity - similarity) so that the most similar pair has distance 0 and the root has the largest distance.\n\nBut the instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". The word "distances" implies that we are using a measure that increases as sequences diverge. \n\nHowever, in the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, we have a similarity score. So we must convert similarity to distance. How? \n\nWe can do: \n   distance = -similarity   (but that would make negative distances if similarity is positive, which is not acceptable)\n\nAlternatively, we can use: \n   distance = max_similarity - similarity   (where max_similarity is the maximum similarity in the entire matrix? but note: the maximum similarity for a pair might be the self-similarity, which is the highest. However, we are building the tree from the scores we computed for every pair, and we don\'t have a fixed maximum. \n\nAnother idea: since the instruction says "raw Needleman-Wunsch distances", but we only have a similarity, we can define the distance as: \n   distance = -log(similarity)   [not suitable because similarity can be negative? and we don\'t know the scale]\n\nAlternatively, we can simply use: \n   distance = (max_similarity_in_matrix) - similarity\n\nBut note: the max_similarity_in_matrix might be the maximum score among all pairs? However, the tree building process uses the similarity scores we computed. We can compute the maximum similarity among all pairs and then set:\n\n   distance_matrix[i, j] = max_similarity - similarity_matrix[i, j]\n\nThis will make the most similar pair have the smallest distance (0) and the least similar have the largest distance.\n\nBut wait: the instruction says "raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". We are not using raw scores, but a transformation. However, we are not given distances but similarities. So we have to transform.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the dendrogram should have the horizontal axis as the similarity score (so higher similarity means closer to the left, and lower similarity (more divergence) means to the right). But note: the instruction says "distances", so maybe they want the opposite? \n\nLet me check the example: \n   "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances"\n\nBut we don\'t have distances, we have similarities. So I think we have to create a distance measure. \n\nThe most straightforward is to use: \n   distance = max_score - similarity\n\nwhere max_score is the maximum similarity score in the entire set of pairs. This will ensure that the distance is non-negative and the most similar pair has distance 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the self-similarity of a sequence as the maximum? But note: the self-similarity is the score when aligning a sequence with itself, which is the highest for that sequence. However, we have computed all pairs, so we can take:\n\n   max_similarity = max(all_scores)   # including self-scores? but we don\'t have self-scores in our pairs? Actually, we computed every pair, but not necessarily self-scores? \n\nBut in the tree building, we start with each species as a leaf. We don\'t need self-scores for the clustering. However, to compute the maximum, we can compute the self-scores? But that\'s extra. Alternatively, we can take the maximum of the computed pairwise scores? But note: the self-scores would be higher than any pairwise score between two different sequences. \n\nSo if we want to include the self-scores, we could compute them. But the instruction doesn\'t require that. \n\nAlternatively, we can set the distance as:\n\n   distance = (max_pairwise_similarity_observed) - similarity\n\nwhere max_pairwise_similarity_observed is the maximum similarity among all pairs we computed (which would be the highest score between any two different species). Then the distance for the most similar pair would be 0.\n\nBut then the self-similarity (if we had it) would be higher. However, we don\'t have self-similarity in our pairs because we didn\'t compute a species with itself? \n\nIn the first task, we computed for every pair of species. We did not compute the same species? The instruction said: "for each pair of species". So we have a matrix without the diagonal? \n\nWe have to decide: \n\nFor the clustering algorithm, we need a distance matrix. We can create a distance matrix D such that:\n\n   D[i, j] = max_similarity - S[i, j]\n\nwhere S[i,j] is the similarity between species i and j, and max_similarity is the maximum value in the entire similarity matrix (including all pairs). \n\nBut note: we don\'t have the self-similarity (diagonal). We can compute the maximum from the available pairs. Then the distance for the most similar pair (which has the highest S[i,j]) will be 0.\n\nThis will work.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the dendrogram in `scipy` is drawn with the vertical axis as the distance at which clusters merge. We are building the tree with the similarity at which clusters merge. So we can set the distance at which two clusters merge as:\n\n   distance_merge = max_similarity - similarity_merge\n\nThen the dendrogram will show the merge events at a height that is the distance (so higher distance means more divergence).\n\nBut the instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". In a dendrogram, the horizontal axis is the leaves (arbitrarily ordered) and the vertical axis (in a vertical dendrogram) is the distance. However, the instruction says to draw horizontally. So in a horizontal dendrogram, the leaves are on the vertical axis and the horizontal axis is the distance.\n\nSo the horizontal axis is the distance (divergence). We are setting the distance at which clusters merge as (max_similarity - similarity_merge). \n\nBut note: the instruction says "raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". We are not using raw, but transformed. However, without a transformation, we cannot use the similarity as a distance because the clustering algorithm requires distance.\n\nWe\'ll proceed with the transformation:\n\n   distance = max_similarity - similarity\n\nand then use this distance for the clustering and for the dendrogram.\n\nSteps for the tree building:\n\n1. Load the precomputed similarity scores from the JSON file (organisms_scores_blosumXX.json).\n2. Create a list of species (the leaves).\n3. Create a distance matrix for the species. The distance between species i and j is: \n        D[i][j] = max_similarity - S[i][j]\n   where S[i][j] is the similarity from the JSON file.\n4. Use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with method=\'single\' to build the linkage matrix. Note: the linkage function expects a condensed distance matrix (or a square matrix). We can use the square form.\n5. Build a tree (for Newick export) and also we can use the linkage matrix for the dendrogram.\n\nHowever, note: the instruction says that the internal nodes should have a height of the similarity score. But in the distance matrix we transformed the similarity to distance. The linkage matrix will have the merge distance (which is max_similarity - similarity_merge). \n\nBut when we save the tree in Newick format with distances, we want the branch lengths to represent the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores? Or the distances? The instruction says: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00)". And the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);". \n\nBut what do these distances represent? In the example, the distance from A to the parent is 1. \n\nIn our case, we want the branch lengths to represent the evolutionary divergence. We have the similarity at the merge event. However, the branch length in a phylogenetic tree is often the amount of change (so we might want to use the distance we computed: max_similarity - similarity). But the instruction says the tree was built with the similarity at the merge event as the height. \n\nLet me re-read: \n   "During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it should have Needleman-Wunsch score assigned as its height."\n\nSo the height of the node is the similarity score (not the distance). \n\nBut in the Newick format with distances, we are expected to write branch lengths. How do we get branch lengths? \n\nIn the agglomerative clustering, the linkage matrix gives the distance between the two clusters being merged. We transformed the similarity to distance for the clustering. But then the linkage matrix will have the merge distance (which is max_similarity - similarity_merge). \n\nBut we want the branch lengths to be the similarity? That doesn\'t match because the branch length should be the amount of change (so distance). \n\nAlternatively, we can store the tree with the node heights being the similarity, and then when writing the Newick with distances, we have to convert the node heights to branch lengths? \n\nHow branch lengths are calculated in the tree? \n\nIn a phylogenetic tree, the branch length leading to a node is the difference between the height of the node and the height of its parent. \n\nBut we are building a tree where each node has a height (the similarity at which it was created). The leaves have height = ? We didn\'t assign a height to the leaves. \n\nWe can set the leaves at height = max_similarity? Because the leaf hasn\'t diverged at all? But wait, the leaf is the present day species. \n\nActually, in a typical UPGMA tree (which uses average linkage and assumes a molecular clock), the height of a leaf is 0 and the height of an internal node is the distance from the present. But we are using single linkage and we are building the tree by merging the most similar first. \n\nWe have to design the tree structure:\n\nEach leaf node: \n   - name: the species name\n   - height: 0? or the self-similarity? We don\'t have self-similarity.\n\nBut note: we are only given the pairwise similarities. \n\nWe can define the height of a leaf as 0. Then the height of an internal node is the similarity at which it was merged (which is the raw Needleman-Wunsch score). Then the branch length from a leaf to its parent would be: \n   branch_length = parent.height - leaf.height = parent.height\n\nBut that would assign the entire divergence to the leaf branch? \n\nAlternatively, we can set the leaf height to be the self-similarity? But we don\'t have that. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we should follow the instruction: the internal node has a height of the similarity score at which the two clusters were merged. The leaves do not have a height assigned? \n\nIn the Newick format, the branch length for a leaf is the distance from the leaf to its parent. How do we compute that? \n\nWe can store the tree as:\n\n   - Each leaf: has a name and a branch length? But we don\'t have branch lengths for leaves.\n\nWe need to reconstruct the branch lengths. \n\nThe common approach in hierarchical clustering for phylogenetics is UPGMA, which produces rooted trees with branch lengths. However, we are using single linkage (which is not typically used for phylogenetics) but the instruction requires it.\n\nWe can use the `to_tree` method of the `scipy` linkage matrix to get a tree object, but note: the linkage matrix we built uses the distance (max_similarity - similarity). Then the tree will have distances as the node heights (in the distance space). We can then convert the node heights back to similarities? \n\nBut the instruction requires the internal node to have the similarity score as its height. \n\nWe are facing a challenge. \n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe can build the tree ourselves without using `scipy` if we want to store the node heights as similarities. We can implement a simple hierarchical clustering that:\n\n   - Starts with each species as a cluster (with height 0? or not storing leaf height).\n   - At each step, find the two clusters with the highest similarity (not converted to distance) and merge them. The new cluster\'s height is that similarity score.\n\nBut then how do we assign branch lengths? \n\nThe branch length for the two clusters being merged would be the difference between the merge similarity and the height of the cluster? But we haven\'t been tracking the height of the clusters. \n\nWe can do:\n\n   - Initially, each cluster (leaf) has a height of 0? \n   - When we merge two clusters, we create a new node with height = similarity of the merge.\n   - Then the branch length for each of the two clusters is: new_node.height - cluster.height\n\nBut wait: if a cluster is a leaf, its height is 0, then the branch length = new_node.height. \n   If a cluster is an internal node, then its height is the similarity at which it was formed, so the branch length = new_node.height - cluster.height.\n\nThis is the same as UPGMA but with single linkage and using similarity instead of distance. \n\nSo we can build the tree by:\n\n   - Maintain a list of current clusters. Each cluster is a tuple: (id, [list of leaves], height) for internal nodes we have the height, for leaves we set height=0? But note: the similarity between two leaves is known, but the similarity between an internal node and a leaf? We are using single linkage: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two elements in the two clusters.\n\nHowever, we precomputed all pairwise similarities. We can store the similarity between every pair of clusters. \n\nBut the number of clusters reduces by one at each step, so we can update a distance matrix (or rather similarity matrix) for the clusters. But we want to use single linkage: \n   similarity(Cluster1, Cluster2) = max{ similarity(x,y) for x in Cluster1, y in Cluster2 }\n\nBut note: we are using similarity, and we want to merge the two clusters with the highest similarity.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   Step 1: Start with each species as a cluster. The height of each cluster (leaf) is 0.\n   Step 2: Compute the similarity between every pair of clusters (initially, this is the pairwise similarity we precomputed).\n   Step 3: Find the two clusters (i, j) with the highest similarity.\n   Step 4: Create a new cluster k = i ∪ j.\n            Set the height of cluster k: height_k = similarity(i,j).\n   Step 5: Compute the branch lengths for i and j to k:\n            branch_i'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 2872, 'total_tokens': 6968, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2688}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2688, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 184}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'c2649d1d-4b71-4b92-a058-87347edbf240', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--e09ebf25-264c-44b5-b1d0-1ce098c56191-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 2872, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 6968, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2688}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description.

Starting with each organism as a separate cluster.\n     b. At each step, merge the two clusters that have the highest similarity (i.e., the highest Needleman-Wunsch score). \n        However, note that in single linkage, the distance between clusters is the minimum distance (or maximum similarity) between any two points in the clusters. \n        But we are using similarity, so we can think of it as: we want the two clusters that have the maximum similarity (which is equivalent to the minimum distance if we convert similarity to distance appropriately).\n     c.

For each threshold in the "thresholds.txt" file, cut the tree at that threshold (which is a similarity score) and then output the clusters (as sets of leaf names) that are connected above that threshold.\n\n Important: Since we are building a dendrogram and the tree from similarity scores, note that higher similarity means closer. We can convert similarity to distance by: \n    distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or (similarity_max - similarity) but note that we don\'t have a natural max. Alternatively, we can use the fact that the tree building in scipy uses distances, so we can use:\n    distance = -similarity   OR   distance = max_possible_score - similarity.\n\n However, the problem states that the internal node should have a height of the similarity score (e.g., 1200). This means that in the dendrogram, the branch lengths (heights) are the similarity scores. \n\n But note: in a typical dendrogram, the y-axis represents the distance at which clusters merge. We want the y-axis to be the similarity. So we are actually going to plot with similarity on the y-axis? The instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" — wait, let me re-read.\n\n Instruction for dendrogram: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" — this is ambiguous. Actually, in a horizontal dendrogram, the leaves are on the y-axis and the x-axis is the distance (or in our case, similarity). However, the instruction says "the x coordinates" — meaning the horizontal axis? But typically the branch lengths are on the horizontal axis in a horizontal dendrogram.\n\n Clarification: We are to lay out the dendrogram horizontally, meaning that the leaves will be on the left (or right) and the branches extend horizontally. The x-axis will represent the similarity (or distance) at which clusters merge.\n\n However, note: the instruction says "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". But we have built the tree using similarity, and we want the branch positions to reflect the similarity. So we can set the branch lengths to be the similarity? But in a dendrogram, the branch length is usually a distance (so lower values mean closer). We have two options:\n\n   Option 1: Treat the similarity as the branch length and then the total horizontal span from a leaf to the root is the total similarity from that leaf to the root? But that doesn\'t make sense because the root has the highest similarity (as the common ancestor) and the leaves have zero? \n\n   Alternatively, we can invert the similarity to get a distance: distance = (max_score - similarity) and then use that for the branch lengths. Then the root would be at (max_score) and the leaves at 0? But note the instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". \n\n   However, the instruction also says: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number" and we are to use integers. So we are to use the raw scores as the branch lengths? \n\n   But wait: in the tree building step, we are assigning the height of the node (the similarity score) as the branch length. So when we draw the dendrogram, we want to use the similarity score as the horizontal position. This is acceptable, but note: the dendrogram will have the leaves aligned at 0 and the root at the highest similarity? Actually, in a typical dendrogram, the root is at the maximum distance (or in our case, maximum similarity) and the leaves are at 0.\n\n   The instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". So we are to use the raw similarity scores (which we called distances in the instruction, but note: in the context of the algorithm, we called them scores) as the horizontal axis.\n\n   So we will use the similarity score as the horizontal axis. This means that two leaves that are very similar will merge at a high similarity score (so they will be close to the right) and then the next merge will be at a lower similarity, etc.\n\n   Actually, the dendrogram is usually drawn with the root at the top (for vertical) or at the right (for horizontal) and the leaves at the bottom/left. The horizontal axis in a horizontal dendrogram is the similarity: so the further to the right, the higher the similarity at which the merge occurred.\n\n   This is acceptable. We will create the dendrogram with the x-axis being the similarity.\n\n 8. For the clustering by threshold: \n      We are given a threshold (a similarity score). We traverse the tree and break the tree at any branch where the similarity (the node\'s height) is below the threshold. Then the connected components (leaves) above that threshold form clusters.\n\n Implementation plan:\n\n We will use:\n   - `json` for reading and writing JSON files.\n   - `scipy` for hierarchical clustering? But note: we are building a tree that we want to output in Newick and also draw, and then do clustering by threshold. We might use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for the clustering and then get the tree structure. However, we also need to assign the height of the nodes as the similarity score. \n\n   Alternatively, we can build the tree ourselves (agglomerative clustering) and then have a tree structure that we can traverse. This gives us full control for Newick output and for the threshold clustering.\n\n   Given the complexity and the need for custom outputs (Newick, dendrogram, and threshold clustering), it might be easier to build the tree manually.\n\n   Steps for building the tree manually:\n\n     We start with each organism as a cluster (leaf node). Each leaf node has:\n        - name: the organism name\n        - height: 0 (or the similarity with itself? but we don\'t have that, and we don\'t need it because the leaf is at the bottom)\n\n     We have a distance matrix (but note: we have a similarity matrix). We can convert similarity to distance by: \n          distance = max_similarity - similarity\n        but note: we want the two most similar (highest similarity) to be the closest (lowest distance). \n\n     However, the algorithm for hierarchical clustering (single linkage) uses a distance matrix. So we can define:\n          distance_matrix[i, j] = (max_score - similarity_score[i, j])\n        where max_score is the maximum similarity score in the entire matrix? But note: the similarity scores can be negative? The example had positive and negative.\n\n     Alternatively, we can use: \n          distance = -similarity_score[i, j]\n\n     But then the distance can be negative if the similarity is positive? That is not allowed. So we can shift by the minimum? \n\n     However, the instruction says: the tree building should use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores as the similarity. And we are to merge the two clusters with the highest similarity. \n\n     How to do agglomerative clustering with a similarity matrix? We can use the similarity matrix directly and in each step pick the maximum similarity (which would be the minimum distance if we set distance = max_possible - similarity). But we don\'t know the max_possible.\n\n     Actually, we can use the similarity matrix without converting to distance if we change the criterion: we are going to merge the two clusters that have the maximum similarity between any two elements in the two clusters (which is single linkage, but for similarity). \n\n     We can implement the algorithm without converting to distance by:\n\n        Step 1: Start with each leaf as a cluster.\n        Step 2: Create a distance matrix (but we don\'t have distance, we have similarity). Actually, we can store the similarity matrix and then in each step, we look for the maximum similarity between any two clusters (by checking all pairs of clusters and the maximum similarity between any two elements from each cluster).\n\n        Step 3: Merge the two clusters with the maximum similarity. The new cluster\'s height (the similarity at which they merge) is that maximum similarity.\n\n        Step 4: Update the similarity matrix: for the new cluster and every other cluster, the similarity is the maximum similarity between any element in the new cluster and any element in the other cluster (single linkage).\n\n        Step 5: Repeat until one cluster.\n\n     This is the same as single linkage clustering, but using similarity (and we take max instead of min).\n\n     We can do this. We have to be cautious because the matrix is symmetric.\n\n     We will represent the tree as a binary tree. Each node will be either:\n        - Leaf: contains name, and height (which we can set to 0 for leaves? but then the branch length from leaf to parent? Actually, the branch length from a leaf to its parent is (parent.height - 0) but we don\'t have a self-similarity for the leaf. \n\n     Instead, we can set the leaf node to have a height of 0? and then the parent node\'s height is the similarity score at which they merge. Then the branch length from leaf to parent would be (parent.height) because the leaf is at 0.\n\n     But note: the example: Horse and Dog merge at 1200. Then the branch from Horse to the parent would be 1200? and from Dog to the parent would be 1200? Then the total distance between Horse and Dog would be 1200+1200=2400? That doesn\'t match the similarity score of 1200.\n\n     Actually, the Needleman-Wunsch score is a similarity score for the entire alignment. It is not a distance. We are using it to build a tree by agglomerative clustering. In the tree, the height of the node (the merge) is the similarity score. The branch lengths are the differences in heights? \n\n     How do we assign branch lengths?\n\n        We can set:\n          For a leaf node: the branch length from the leaf to its parent is (parent.height - 0) = parent.height.\n          For an internal node: the branch length from the node to its parent is (parent.height - node.height).\n\n        Then the distance between two leaves would be the sum of the branch lengths along the path. But note: we don\'t have a distance, we have a similarity. We are not building a distance tree? We are building a similarity tree? \n\n     The problem states: the internal node should have a height of 1200. And in the Newick format with distances, we are to write the branch lengths as integers. So we must assign branch lengths as described.\n\n     However, the Needleman-Wunsch score between two leaves is 1200, and then the branch lengths from each leaf to the parent are 1200? Then the total path between the two leaves would be 2400? That is inconsistent because we started with a similarity of 1200.\n\n     This indicates that we should not use the branch lengths as the absolute heights. Instead, we should use the differences.\n\n     How about: \n        When we merge two clusters (A and B) at a similarity S, then we set the branch length for A to be (S - A.height) and for B to be (S - B.height). \n\n        Initially, each leaf has height 0? Then the branch from leaf A to the new node would be (S - 0) = S, and similarly for B: S. Then the distance between A and B would be 2*S? But we want the distance to be inversely related to the similarity? \n\n     Alternatively, we can think of the height of the node as the time of divergence? Then the branch length is the time from the divergence to the children? \n\n     Actually, in phylogenetics, the branch lengths are often the amount of evolutionary change (and the distance between two species is the total branch length along the path). We don\'t have an evolutionary model here. \n\n     The instruction says: the internal node should have a height of the similarity score. And for the Newick format, we are to write the branch lengths. How do we assign branch lengths?\n\n        We can set the height of each node (the similarity at which the node was created). Then the branch length from a node to its parent is (parent.height - node.height).\n\n        For a leaf, we set the height to 0? Then the branch from leaf to parent is (parent.height - 0) = parent.height.\n\n        For an internal node that was created at height h1 and then merged again at height h2 (with h2>h1, because we are merging from high similarity to low?), then the branch from that internal node to the new parent is (h2 - h1).\n\n        But note: we are merging from highest similarity to lowest? Actually, we start with the highest similarity and then lower ones. So the root will have the lowest similarity? \n\n        But wait: the root is the last merge, so it should have the lowest similarity? That would be the root at the bottom? \n\n        Alternatively, we can invert the similarity: we want the root to have the highest similarity? But the problem says: we merge the most similar first. So the first merges are at high similarity, then we merge clusters that are less similar. The root will be the merge of the last two clusters at the lowest similarity.\n\n        So the root will have the smallest height (if we use the similarity as height). Then the leaves are at height 0, and the internal nodes are at positive heights (the similarity scores) but decreasing as we go up? \n\n        This is acceptable. Then the branch length from a node to its parent is (node.height - parent.height) because the parent is lower? But then the branch length would be negative? \n\n        We need to invert the heights: we can set the height of a node to be (max_possible_similarity - similarity) so that the root has the highest value? But the problem says: the internal node should have the raw similarity score as height.\n\n        How about we store the similarity as the node\'s attribute, and then when we assign branch lengths, we do:\n\n          For a node, the branch length from the node to its parent is (node.similarity - parent.similarity) [if we traverse from child to parent, the parent is less similar, so node.similarity > parent.similarity?]\n\n        Actually, when we merge two clusters at similarity s, we create a new node with similarity s. Then when that node is merged again at a lower similarity s_parent, the branch length from this node to the new parent is (s - s_parent) [but this is negative?]\n\n        Alternatively, we can store the height of the node as the similarity, and then the branch length is the drop from the parent to the child? \n\n        But note: the Newick format with distances expects positive branch lengths. \n\n        We can define: the branch length from a node to its parent is (parent.similarity - node.similarity). Since parent.similarity < node.similarity (because we merge at decreasing similarity as we go up), then this would be negative? \n\n        We must have positive branch lengths. So we invert the similarity by: \n\n            height = max_similarity - similarity\n\n        where max_similarity is the maximum similarity we encountered in the entire matrix? Then the branch length from node to parent is (node.height - parent.height) = ( (max_similarity - node.similarity) - (max_similarity - parent.similarity) ) = (parent.similarity - node.similarity) [positive because parent.similarity > node.similarity? no, because parent is merged later at a lower similarity?]\n\n        Actually, if we define:\n\n            node.height = max_score - node.similarity\n\n        then the branch length from node to parent is (parent.height - node.height) = (max_score - parent.similarity) - (max_score - node.similarity) = (node.similarity - parent.similarity) [which is positive because node.similarity > parent.similarity?] \n\n        But wait: the parent is created later (at a lower similarity) so parent.similarity < node.similarity. Then (node.similarity - parent.similarity) is positive.\n\n        Then the total distance between two leaves would be the sum of the branch lengths along the path. And that would be (leaf1.similarity - parent1.similarity) + (leaf2.similarity - parent1.similarity) + ...? \n\n        But note: we don\'t have an additive measure in terms of the original similarity. We are converting to a distance.\n\n        However, the problem does not require the branch lengths to be additive with respect to the Needleman-Wunsch score. It only requires that the internal node has a similarity score stored (which we can store as an attribute) and that the Newick format writes the branch lengths as integers (which we are doing as the difference in the converted height).\n\n        And for the dendrogram, we want the x-axis to be the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances? But wait, the instruction says "raw Needleman-Wunsch distances", but we have scores. We are storing the node.similarity. We can plot the dendrogram using the node.similarity as the x-axis? But then the leaves would be at the maximum similarity? and the root at the minimum? \n\n        The instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". So we are to use the similarity score as the x-axis? And then the leaves would be aligned at the maximum similarity? and the merges happen to the left (decreasing similarity)? \n\n        We can do that. We can set the `dendrogram` function in matplotlib to use the similarity as the x-axis. But the `scipy` dendrogram function uses distances.'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3071, 'total_tokens': 7167, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2816}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2816, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 255}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'f41fdb40-cf9a-487d-ac3a-09add2b32e66', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--7ae5f620-ffb7-4a47-805d-50812628e405-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3071, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 7167, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2816}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are at the final task: generating clusters for given thresholds and saving them.\n We have built a phylogenetic tree (using hierarchical clustering with single linkage) and stored it in a tree structure (using the Bio.Phylo module).\n Now, for each threshold in the "thresholds.txt" file, we want to cut the tree at that threshold and get the clusters (each cluster is a set of leaf nodes that are still connected at that height).\n\n Steps:\n 1. Read the thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file (each line is an integer).\n 2. For each threshold, traverse the tree and form clusters: \n    - We can use the `get_nonterminals` method of the tree to get internal nodes, but actually we want to cut the tree at a given height (which is our threshold).\n    - We note that in our tree, the height of an internal node is the similarity score (Needleman-Wunsch score) at which the two clusters were merged.\n    - We are using single linkage, so the distance between clusters is the maximum similarity (but note: we built the tree using similarity, not distance. However, for cutting we can think of the threshold as a minimum similarity to be connected? Actually, in the tree, the height is the similarity score. So we want to consider two leaves connected if the path between them has a minimum height (similarity) at least the threshold? But note: in the tree, the root has the highest similarity? Actually, no: the leaves are at the bottom and the root is the highest node. The height of a node is the similarity at which the merge happened. So to form clusters, we can think: we cut the tree at a threshold `t`, meaning we break the tree at every edge where the node\'s height is less than `t`? Actually, we want to break the tree at every node that has a height below the threshold? Then the connected components above the threshold are the clusters.\n\n However, note: the tree was built by merging the most similar (highest score) first. So the root has the smallest similarity? Actually, no: the root is the last merge and it should have the lowest similarity? But in our algorithm we started by merging the two with the highest similarity (so that node has a high height). Then we merge the next most similar, and so on until the root. So the root\'s height is the similarity of the last merge, which is the smallest similarity in the tree.\n\n Actually, in the tree we built, the height of a node is the similarity score at which the two clusters were merged. Therefore, if we have a threshold `t`, we want to consider two leaves to be in the same cluster if the last common ancestor of these two leaves has a height >= `t`? Because that means they were merged at a similarity of at least `t`. But note: the entire tree is built so that the similarity of the common ancestor of two leaves is the minimum similarity along the path? Actually, in single linkage, the distance (or similarity) between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two points in the two clusters? But we stored the node height as the similarity at which we merged the two clusters. For the purpose of cutting the tree, we can use the following:\n\n In a dendrogram, the cluster formation at a threshold `t` (if we are using similarity) would be: we break the tree at every node that has height < t. Then the connected components (each connected subtree that remains) forms a cluster.\n\n But note: the root has the smallest similarity? Actually, we built the tree by starting with the highest similarity and then progressively lower. So the root node has the lowest similarity (because it was the last merge). Therefore, we want to break the tree at every node that has height < t. Then the clusters are the subtrees that are still connected above the cut.\n\n How to do this with Bio.Phylo?\n We can use the `cut` method? Actually, Bio.Phylo has a `cut` function in the `Phylo.BaseTree` module. But note: our tree is stored as a `Tree` object.\n\n Alternatively, we can traverse the tree and collect clusters by checking the node heights.\n\n Steps for one threshold:\n   - Start from the root and traverse the tree.\n   - If we encounter a node with height < t, then we break the tree at that node and consider its children as separate clusters? But note: we might break at multiple levels.\n\n Actually, we can do:\n   - We traverse the tree and for every node, if the node\'s height >= t, then we consider that the node is above the threshold and we don\'t break there. Then we go down until we find nodes that are below the threshold? But then we break at that node and take the children as separate clusters.\n\n However, note: the tree is binary? We built it as a binary tree (each node has two children). So we can do:\n\n   We define a recursive function that, given a node and a threshold, returns a list of clusters (each cluster is a list of leaf names) that are in the subtree of that node and that are connected above the threshold.\n\n   But if the node is a leaf, we return a cluster containing just that leaf.\n\n   If the node is internal:\n        - If the node\'s height >= t, then we do not break at this node. So we get the clusters from the left and right children and merge them? Actually, no: we don\'t merge because we are above the threshold. Instead, we return the union of the clusters from the left and right? But that would be one big cluster? Actually, if we don\'t break at this node, then the entire subtree is one cluster.\n\n        - If the node\'s height < t, then we break at this node. Then we return the clusters from the left child and the clusters from the right child as separate clusters.\n\n However, note: the children might be internal nodes that also have heights. So we break at the first node that is below the threshold? Then we return the clusters from the two children.\n\n But wait: what if one of the children is an internal node with a height that is above the threshold? Then that child\'s subtree would form one cluster? And the other child might form multiple? Actually, we are breaking at the current node, so we return the clusters from the left and the clusters from the right separately.\n\n Therefore, the recursive function:\n\n   def get_clusters(node, threshold):\n        if node.is_terminal():\n            return [[node.name]]\n\n        # Check the height of the node. Note: we stored the height in the node\'s \'height\' attribute? (We set it when building the tree)\n        left_clusters = get_clusters(node.clades[0], threshold)\n        right_clusters = get_clusters(node.clades[1], threshold)\n\n        if node.height >= threshold:\n            # We do not break: merge all clusters from left and right into one cluster?\n            # Actually, we want one cluster that is the union of all leaves in the left and right.\n            # But note: the left_clusters and right_clusters are lists of clusters (each cluster is a list of leaf names). So we can combine all the leaves from all clusters in left and right into one cluster?\n            # However, that would be one cluster? But wait: the entire subtree is above the threshold, so it is one connected component? Then we return one cluster that is the concatenation of all the leaves in the subtree.\n\n            # But note: the recursive call returns a list of clusters for the subtree. We want to merge them all into one cluster? Actually, no: because the recursive call might have broken the subtree into multiple clusters? But if we are above the threshold at this node, we are not breaking here, but we might have broken at lower nodes? Actually, no: because the recursive call already broke the children if necessary. And if we are above the threshold, then we are overriding that break? \n\n            # Actually, we break only at nodes below the threshold. So if the current node is above the threshold, then we do not break, so the entire subtree is one cluster. Therefore, we combine all the leaves from left and right into one big cluster.\n\n            # How to combine: we can take the union of all the leaves? Actually, we have a list of clusters from the left and a list from the right. We can merge them into one cluster? But note: each cluster is a list of leaf names. We want to return a list of one cluster that has all the leaves.\n\n            all_leaves = []\n            for cluster in left_clusters:\n                all_leaves.extend(cluster)\n            for cluster in right_clusters:\n                all_leaves.extend(cluster)\n            return [all_leaves]\n        else:\n            # Break at this node: so we return the clusters from the left and the clusters from the right as separate clusters.\n            return left_clusters + right_clusters\n\n However, note: this algorithm will break the tree at every node that is below the threshold, and then the clusters are the connected components above the threshold.\n\n But what if the current node is above the threshold? Then we are not breaking, so we combine the entire subtree into one cluster.\n\n This seems correct.\n\n However, we must note: the root node is the last merge and has the smallest similarity. So if the threshold is very low (below the root\'s height) then we get one cluster? Actually, the root\'s height is the smallest similarity in the tree. So if the threshold is below the root\'s height, then we don\'t break at the root? Then we get one cluster? But that is correct: if the threshold is very low, then we require very little similarity to be connected, so all species are in one cluster.\n\n Alternatively, if the threshold is very high (above the highest similarity in the tree), then we break at every internal node? Then each leaf is its own cluster.\n\n Steps:\n\n   We\'ll read the thresholds from the file, then for each threshold we call `get_clusters(tree.root, threshold)` and then we get a list of clusters.\n\n   However, note: our tree is stored as a `Tree` object from Bio.Phylo. The root of the tree is `tree.root`.\n\n   Also, we stored the height in the `height` attribute of each node? Yes, when we built the tree we set `node.height = score`.\n\n   But note: the leaves (terminal nodes) don\'t have a height? We can set the height of leaves to be a very high number? Or we can avoid using leaves in the condition? In our recursive function, we check if the node is terminal and then return the leaf. Then for internal nodes we use the height.\n\n   However, in the condition for internal nodes, we check the height. But what about the leaves? They are handled separately.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We\'ll assume that the tree we built (using the `to_tree` method of the `hcluster` module) has set the `height` attribute for internal nodes. The leaves don\'t have a height? Actually, the `to_tree` method sets the `distance` attribute? But we stored the similarity as `height`? Let me recall:\n\n   In the previous step, when building the tree, we did:\n\n        tree = to_tree(linkage_matrix, rd=False)\n\n   Then we traversed the tree and set the height for each internal node? Actually, we did:\n\n        def set_heights(node):\n            if node.is_terminal():\n                # Leaf: we don\'t set a height? But we can set it to a high value? \n                # Actually, for the leaf, we don\'t use the height in the condition? Because in the recursive function we handle leaves separately.\n                return\n            set_heights(node.left)\n            set_heights(node.right)\n            # The height of the node is the similarity at which it was merged? But note: the linkage matrix uses distances? We stored the similarity? Actually, we converted the similarity to a distance? \n\n   Wait: in the previous step we built the tree using a linkage matrix that was built from the distances. We converted the similarity to distance by: `distance = max_similarity - similarity`. Then we built the tree. Then when we set the height, we set it to the original similarity? \n\n   Actually, we did:\n\n        node.height = max_similarity - node.distance\n\n   So the height of an internal node is the original similarity score.\n\n   And for leaves, we did not set a height? We can set the height of a leaf to a very high value? For example, we can set it to the maximum similarity in the entire matrix? Then when we are at a leaf, we never break? That is, we always consider a leaf as a cluster of one? And that\'s what we want.\n\n   But in the recursive function above, we don\'t use the leaf\'s height. We just return the leaf as a cluster. So we don\'t need to set the height for leaves? However, to avoid an error, we can set the height for leaves to a high value (so that the condition `node.height >= threshold` would be true for any threshold we have). But note: we never check the height of a leaf? Because in the recursive function, we check for terminal and then return.\n\n   So we can leave the leaf without a height? Then in the recursive function, we don\'t access `node.height` for a leaf. That is safe.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the leaf height to None? But then we might get an error. So let\'s set the leaf height to a value that is higher than any threshold? We can set it to the maximum possible similarity (which is the maximum score in the similarity matrix) plus one? But we don\'t have that stored. Alternatively, we can set it to a very large number (like 1e9). But note: the thresholds are integers from the range of the similarity scores (which are in the thousands?).\n\n   Actually, we can avoid the issue by not using the height of leaves? So we can adjust the recursive function to only check height for non-terminal nodes.\n\n   We already do: we check if the node is terminal first. So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, we can implement the recursive function as described.\n\n   But note: the `Tree` object in Bio.Phylo has the root node, and each node has:\n        - `is_terminal()`: True if leaf.\n        - `clades`: list of child nodes (for internal node, two children).\n\n   We\'ll write a helper function `get_clusters(node, threshold)`.\n\n   Then, for each threshold, we call this function on the root and get a list of clusters.\n\n   We must note: the clusters are lists of leaf names. We want to output them as a list of lists.\n\n   Then we store the result for that threshold.\n\n   We do this for every threshold.\n\n   Then we output to stdout and also save to a JSON file.\n\n Implementation plan:\n\n   We\'ll modify the main script to include this step.\n\n   Steps in the main script (for a given BLOSUM version):\n        1. Read organisms and blosum matrix.\n        2. Compute the similarity matrix (for every pair of organisms) and store in a dictionary (key: (org1, org2), value: score).\n        3. Build the linkage matrix for hierarchical clustering (using single linkage) but converting similarity to distance (max_sim - sim).\n        4. Build the tree (using `hierarchy.to_tree`).\n        5. Set the heights for the internal nodes (as we did: node.height = max_similarity - node.distance).\n        6. Save the tree in Newick format (we did that already? We will integrate this step in the same script? Actually, we are building the entire pipeline in one script? But we have broken the code into functions and multiple files? Actually, we have a main script that does everything step by step).\n\n   Now, we add:\n        7. Read thresholds from "thresholds.txt".\n        8. For each threshold, compute the clusters by calling `get_clusters` on the root.\n        9. Print the clusters for the threshold (to stdout) and also store in a dictionary (key: threshold, value: clusters).\n        10. Save the dictionary to a JSON file.\n\n   We are going to modify the existing code to include step 7-10.\n\n   We\'ll create a function for step 8: `get_clusters(node, threshold)`.\n\n   We must be cautious: the tree we built (using `to_tree`) is a binary tree. And we set the heights for internal nodes.\n\n   Let\'s write the helper function:\n\n        def get_clusters(node, threshold):\n            if node.is_terminal():\n                # For a leaf, we return a cluster with just the leaf\'s name.\n                return [[node.name]]\n            # Otherwise, get clusters from the two children\n            left_clusters = get_clusters(node.clades[0], threshold)\n            right_clusters = get_clusters(node.clades[1], threshold)\n\n            # Check the height of the current node (which is an internal node)\n            if node.height >= threshold:\n                # Merge all clusters from left and right into one cluster\n                merged_cluster = []\n                for cluster in left_clusters:\n                    merged_cluster.extend(cluster)\n                for cluster in right_clusters:\n                    merged_cluster.extend(cluster)\n                return [merged_cluster]\n            else:\n                # Return the clusters from left and right as separate\n                return left_clusters + right_clusters\n\n   However, note: the above function for the internal node that is above the threshold merges all the clusters from the left and right into one big cluster? Actually, that is correct because the entire subtree is above the threshold? But wait: what if the left child itself was broken into multiple clusters? Then we are merging them all? Yes, because if the current node is above the threshold, then we are not breaking at the current node, so the entire subtree becomes one cluster.\n\n   But note: the left_clusters might be a list of multiple clusters (if the left child had breaks below) and similarly for the right. Then we merge them all? That means we are overriding the breaks that happened below? Yes, because the current node being above the threshold means that the entire subtree is connected at this level? So we want to merge them.\n\n   However, this is not the standard way? In hierarchical clustering, when we cut at a threshold, we break the tree at every edge that is below the threshold, and then the connected components above the threshold are the clusters. The above function does exactly that.\n\n   But note: the tree we built is a binary tree? Yes.\n\n   Let\'s test with a small tree:\n\n        Root (height=10)\n          /   \\\n        A(leaf)  Internal (height=20)\n                   /   \\\n                 B(leaf) C(leaf)\n\n        Threshold = 15:\n          - At the root (10): 10 < 15 -> break, so we return clusters from left and right.\n          - Left: A -> cluster [A]\n          - Right: Internal node (height=20): 20>=15 -> so we merge the clusters from its children: [B] and [C] -> merged to [B, C]\n          - So we return [ [A], [B, C] ]\n\n        Threshold = 5:\n          - Root: 10>=5 -> merge the clusters from left and right: left is [A], right is [B, C'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3246, 'total_tokens': 7342, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 3008}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 3008, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 238}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'af9c6a19-6b2f-4bd5-a212-c07abd4e7316', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--f431e75e-f80b-4f62-93fd-a8e537df0b45-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3246, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 7342, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 3008}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are at the final step: checking if the solution covers all requirements.\n\n Let me recap the entire project flow and requirements:\n\n 1. **First Task: Calculate Needleman-Wunsch scores for all pairs of species.**\n    - Inputs: \n        - `organisms.json`: dictionary with species names (keys) and amino acid sequences (values).\n        - `blosumXX.json` (where XX is 50 or 62): substitution matrix and gap penalties. The keys are either single letters (gap penalty) or two letters (substitution score). Note: the example had keys like "a", "b", "ab", "ba", etc.\n    - Output: \n        - A dictionary (or similar structure) that stores the Needleman-Wunsch score for every pair of species, stored for fast access (we used a dictionary with keys as "species1_species2").\n        - The scores must be integers (no decimal points).\n        - The results are saved to `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` (with XX matching the input matrix).\n\n 2. **Second Task: Build a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering (agglomerative, single linkage) based on similarity (higher score = more similar).**\n    - We start with each species as a leaf node.\n    - We merge the two most similar (highest Needleman-Wunsch score) clusters (initially single species) at each step, creating a new internal node.\n    - The internal node is assigned a height (or distance) equal to the Needleman-Wunsch score that caused the merge.\n    - We end up with a root node that is the common ancestor.\n    - The tree must be built in such a way that we can:\n        - Save two Newick format files:\n            - `tree_blosumXX_newick.nw`: without branch lengths, only topology and leaf names.\n            - `tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`: with branch lengths (as integers, no decimals). Note: In Newick, branch lengths are typically from a node to its child. However, in our case, the height of a node (the similarity score at which it was formed) is the key. We have to represent the tree such that the branch lengths are the differences in heights between a node and its parent? But note: the problem says the internal node has a height of the similarity score. For the dendrogram, the x-axis will be the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (heights). So we must design the tree so that the horizontal position of the node is the height (similarity score). \n\n        - Draw a dendrogram and save as `phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png` with horizontal layout and x-axis as the Needleman-Wunsch scores (heights).\n\n 3. **Third Task: Generate clusters for given thresholds.**\n    - Input: `thresholds.txt` - each line is an integer threshold (from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores).\n    - For each threshold, we traverse the tree and form clusters: all leaves that are connected at a height (similarity score) above the threshold form one cluster.\n    - Output:\n        - Print to standard output the clusters for each threshold.\n        - Save to `clusters_for_blosumXX.json`: a dictionary where keys are thresholds (as integers) and values are lists of clusters (each cluster is a list of species names).\n\n Additional requirements:\n    - Code in Python 3.11, using chosen libraries (we used: `json`, `numpy` for efficient array operations in NW, `matplotlib` and `scipy` for dendrogram, and `biopython` for Newick? But note: we built our own tree structure so we can write Newick ourselves without biopython? Actually, we used `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for the clustering and dendrogram, and then we used `to_tree` method to get a tree structure for Newick and cluster extraction).\n    - Paths: current directory and subfolders? We are reading from and writing to the current directory.\n    - PEP8 formatting.\n\n Now, let me check the code we generated in previous steps:\n\n **Step 1: Needleman-Wunsch calculation (file: nw_alignment.py)**\n    - We implemented the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm using dynamic programming.\n    - We read `organisms.json` and `blosumXX.json`.\n    - We computed the score for every pair of species and stored in a dictionary (key: "species1_species2", value: integer score).\n    - We saved the dictionary to `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`.\n\n **Step 2: Building the tree (file: clustering.py)**\n    - We used the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` module for hierarchical clustering.\n    - We converted the similarity scores to a distance matrix: since the algorithm uses distances, we transformed the similarity score `s` to a distance by: `distance = max_score - s` (where `max_score` is the maximum similarity score in the matrix). This ensures that the most similar (highest score) becomes the smallest distance.\n    - We performed single linkage clustering (since we are using the minimum distance between clusters, which corresponds to the maximum similarity between any two elements in the clusters).\n    - We built a linkage matrix using `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with method=\'single\'.\n    - We stored the linkage matrix and the list of species names.\n\n **Step 3: Saving the tree in Newick format (file: tree_utils.py)**\n    - We used `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.to_tree` to convert the linkage matrix to a tree object (a binary tree of `ClusterNode` objects).\n    - We wrote two recursive functions to convert the tree to Newick format:\n        - `get_newick(node, parent_height, leaf_names)`: without branch lengths -> only topology. We return a string like "(A,B,(C,D))".\n        - `get_newick_with_distances(node, parent_height, leaf_names)`: with branch lengths. The branch length for a node is calculated as `(parent_height - node.height)`? But note: in our transformation, the node.height in the `ClusterNode` is the distance (from the linkage matrix) at which the node was formed. However, we want the x-axis (in the dendrogram) to be the raw Needleman-Wunsch score. How did we relate the distance to the similarity? \n\n        We had: \n          distance = max_score - similarity\n          => similarity = max_score - distance\n\n        Therefore, the height (similarity) of a node is: `max_score - node.distance`? But note: the linkage matrix\'s distances are the ones we computed (max_score - similarity). So the node.height in the `ClusterNode` is the distance (computed as max_score - similarity) at which the node was formed.\n\n        However, for the Newick with distances, we want to represent the branch lengths as the difference in the raw similarity? Or the difference in the distance? \n\n        Actually, in the dendrogram drawing, we set the `dendrogram` function to use the original distance (which we then convert to similarity for the x-axis by: `x_axis = max_score - distance`). But for the Newick file with distances, we are required to output integers without decimals and the distances should be the branch lengths in the tree. \n\n        Important: The Newick format typically represents the branch length from the node to its parent. However, in our tree, the node\'s stored value (in the `ClusterNode`) is the distance (from the linkage) at which the node was formed. The root node has the maximum distance (which corresponds to the minimum similarity). \n\n        How we calculated the branch lengths for Newick?\n          We defined the branch length for a node as the difference between the parent\'s distance and the current node\'s distance? But note: the linkage matrix does not directly give the branch lengths for each node. The `ClusterNode` in scipy has a `dist` attribute which is the distance from the node to its children? Actually, the `ClusterNode` has:\n            - `left`: left child\n            - `right`: right child\n            - `dist`: the distance between the two children (which is the node\'s height in the linkage tree?).\n\n        We designed the Newick functions as follows:\n\n          For a leaf node: \n             branch_length = (max_score - 0) - (max_score - node.dist)   ??? \n\n        Actually, we did not store the `max_score` in the tree. We used a different approach:\n\n          We stored the original similarity scores in the tree nodes? No.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reconstruct the similarity for each node: \n          similarity = max_score - node.dist   [for the node]\n\n        But note: the root node has the largest distance (because it\'s the last merge) and therefore the smallest similarity? That would be the opposite of what we want (we want the root to have the lowest similarity). \n\n        We must reconsider: \n\n          We built the distance matrix as: \n             dist_matrix[i][j] = max_score - sim_score[i][j]\n\n          Then, in the linkage, the distance between clusters is the minimum distance between any two points in the clusters (which is the maximum similarity between any two points in the clusters). \n\n          The linkage matrix then has distances that are increasing (as we merge). The root node has the maximum distance (which is max_score - min_similarity_encountered?).\n\n        For the Newick with distances, we want to represent the branch lengths as the differences in the raw similarity? Or the differences in the distance? \n\n        The problem states: \n          "second one should save both leaf nodes\' names and distances between branches in the tree"\n\n        And the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);"\n\n        The numbers are the branch lengths (from the node to the parent). \n\n        In our tree, we have:\n\n          Each node (internal) has a height (the similarity at which it was formed). The branch length for a leaf would be: (root height) - (leaf height) ? But the leaves are at height = max_score? (because the similarity of a leaf with itself is the maximum? but we never computed that). \n\n        Actually, we did not assign a height to the leaves. We started by having each leaf as a cluster at height = 0? Then the branch length from a leaf to its parent would be the parent\'s similarity (because the leaf started at 0 and the parent is formed at similarity s, so the branch length is s). But that doesn\'t match because the parent\'s similarity is the similarity between the two children.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the distance from the linkage tree: \n\n          In the Newick tree from scipy, the branch lengths are typically the distances stored in the linkage. But note: the `to_tree` method in scipy returns a tree where each node has:\n             - `dist`: the distance (from the linkage) for that node (i.e., the distance at which the node was formed).\n             - `left` and `right`: children.\n\n          The branch length for a child node is the difference between the parent\'s distance and the child\'s distance? Not exactly: the child\'s distance is the distance at which the child node was formed (if the child is an internal node) or 0 (if the child is a leaf). \n\n          We designed the Newick function to use the node\'s `dist` as the branch length? But that would be the absolute distance (which is max_score - similarity) and we want the branch length to be in terms of similarity? \n\n        Clarification from the problem: \n          The dendrogram must have the x-axis as the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (heights). So the horizontal position of a node is the similarity score at which it was formed.\n\n        Therefore, the branch length in the Newick with distances should be the difference in the similarity score between the node and its parent? \n\n        However, note: the problem says "distances between branches in the tree" and the example uses integers. We are to use integers.\n\n        We did the following in the code for Newick with distances:\n\n          We defined the branch length for a node as the difference between the parent\'s similarity and the node\'s similarity? \n\n          But wait, the similarity for a leaf is not defined? We can set the leaf\'s similarity to max_score? (the self-similarity) but we never computed self-scores. \n\n        Actually, we only computed the scores between different species. The self-scores would be the score of aligning a sequence with itself, which we can compute? But the problem did not require that. \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the similarity of a leaf as the maximum possible similarity? But that is arbitrary.\n\n        How we handled in the dendrogram? \n\n          In the dendrogram, the leaf nodes are at x=0? Actually, no: the dendrogram in `scipy` by default uses the distance. We set the x-axis to be the similarity? \n\n        We did a transformation in the dendrogram drawing:\n\n          We set the `ax.set_xlabel("Similarity (Needleman-Wunsch score)") and then set the x-axis ticks to show similarity? We didn\'t change the data, we just changed the labels? \n\n        Actually, we did:\n\n          We computed the linkage with distances (d = max_score - s). Then the dendrogram function plots the distances (so the x-axis is in distance units). Then we transformed the x-axis labels to show similarity = max_score - distance.\n\n        But the problem says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" (meaning the similarity scores). So we set the x-axis to be the similarity by:\n\n          We set the x-axis limits to be (max_score, min_similarity) but then the dendrogram is drawn with the distance? \n\n        We did a trick: we inverted the x-axis and set the labels to the similarity. But the positions are still in distance? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set the `orientation=\'left\'` and then use the similarity as the horizontal axis? \n\n        We did:\n\n          We created a dendrogram with `orientation=\'left\'` so that the tree grows horizontally. Then we set the x-axis to be the distance (which is max_score - similarity). Then we inverted the x-axis so that the highest similarity (lowest distance) is at the top? \n\n        Actually, we set:\n\n          dendrogram(..., orientation=\'left\', ...)\n          ax.set_xlim(max_score, min_score)   # but we set the x-axis to the similarity by inverting the distance? \n\n        We did:\n\n          We computed the linkage with the distance matrix (d = max_score - s). Then the dendrogram is drawn with the x-axis being the distance. Then we changed the x-axis labels to show the similarity (by: label = max_score - distance). But the positions of the nodes are still the distance? \n\n        The requirement: the x coordinates should be the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores. So we must set the positions to the similarity. \n\n        We did:\n\n          We created a custom transformation: we set the x-axis data to be max_score - (the distance value) for every point. But the dendrogram function doesn\'t allow that. \n\n        Instead, we can flip the axis and set the limits. We did:\n\n          ax.set_xlim(max_score, min_score)   # but this is just for the view, the data is still distance.\n\n        How we actually drew the dendrogram:\n\n          We used the `dendrogram` function with the linkage matrix and labels. Then we set:\n\n             ax = plt.gca()\n             # We want the x-axis to be the similarity (which is max_score - distance)\n             # But the dendrogram plotted the distance on the x-axis (for horizontal orientation, the x-axis is the distance).\n\n          Then we set:\n\n             # Change the x-axis tick labels to show similarity\n             x_ticks = ax.get_xticks()\n             ax.set_xticklabels([int(max_score - x) for x in x_ticks])\n\n          But the positions of the nodes are still the distance. The problem requires the x coordinates (the horizontal positions) to be the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores. \n\n        We did not meet the requirement? \n\n        We must fix: we want the dendrogram to be drawn with the horizontal position being the similarity. We can achieve this by:\n\n          - Instead of using the distance matrix (d = max_score - s) for clustering, we could use the similarity as a measure of closeness and invert the linkage? But the linkage algorithm expects distances.\n\n        Alternatively, we can create a custom dendrogram by building the tree ourselves? We did not do that.\n\n        We decided to use the distance matrix and then adjust the positions in the dendrogram? But that is complex.\n\n        Actually, the `dendrogram` function does not allow us to set the positions arbitrarily. \n\n        We must reconsider the entire approach for the tree building? \n\n        However, note: the requirement for the tree building step was that the internal node should have a height of the similarity score. In the `ClusterNode` we stored the distance (d = max_score - similarity). So the height of the node (in terms of similarity) is: `sim = max_score - node.dist`. \n\n        For the Newick with distances, we want to output the branch lengths as the differences in the similarity? \n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact meaning of the branch lengths in the Newick file. It only gives an example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);"\n\n        In the context of phylogenetics, the branch lengths usually represent the amount of evolution (e.g., substitutions per site). In our case, we don\'t have that. We have the similarity at which the node was formed. \n\n        How we generated the Newick:\n\n          For a leaf node: we return the leaf name and the branch length from the leaf to its parent as `node.dist`? But that would be the distance (max_score - similarity) and we want the similarity? \n\n        We did not store the similarity in the node. We stored the distance (from the linkage). \n\n        We have two options:\n\n          Option 1: Rebuild the tree nodes to store the similarity (instead of the distance) for the height. Then the branch length for a leaf node would be the parent\'s similarity (if we consider that the leaf is at similarity = max_score, then the branch length would be max_score - parent_similarity). But we don\'t have the self-similarity.\n\n          Option 2: Use the distance for the branch lengths in the Newick and then when drawing the dendrogram, we adjust the labels to show similarity? And for the Newick with distances, we output the distance (which is max_score - similarity) as the branch length? \n\n        The problem says: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers". It doesn\'t specify that the distances must be the similarity. It says "distances between branches". \n\n        However, the example in the problem for the Newick with distances is just an example.

   Example: `{"a":-1, "aa":2, "ab":-3...}`
3. `thresholds.txt`: One threshold per line  
   Example: `1260`

## Usage
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
