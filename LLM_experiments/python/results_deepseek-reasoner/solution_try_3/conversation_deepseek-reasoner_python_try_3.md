## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to build a phylogenetic tree from amino acid sequences using the following steps:\n\n 1. **Similarity Calculation**: \n    - We have amino acid sequences for multiple species.\n    - We will use the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (a global alignment algorithm) to compute the similarity (or distance) between every pair of sequences.\n    - We are given a predefined dictionary of swapping scores (substitution matrix) for amino acids.\n\n 2. **Distance Matrix**:\n    - After computing the pairwise alignment scores, we will convert these scores into a distance matrix. Note: sometimes we use similarity and then convert to distance. We must decide on the conversion (e.g., distance = 1 - similarity, or use the alignment score in a way that higher scores indicate similarity and then use a negative exponential? But typically for Needleman-Wunsch, we have a score that we can convert to a distance by taking the negative or by using the maximum possible score? Actually, we might want to use the alignment score as a measure of similarity and then convert to a distance by: distance = max_score - score, or use a normalized version?).\n\n 3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**:\n    - We will use the distance matrix to build a phylogenetic tree. We can use algorithms like UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) or Neighbor-Joining (NJ). Since the problem mentions building a dendrogram, UPGMA produces a rooted tree that is often represented as a dendrogram.\n\n 4. **Dendrogram Visualization**:\n    - We will visualize the phylogenetic tree as a dendrogram.\n\n 5. **Clustering by Threshold**:\n    - We will provide a way to cut the dendrogram at a given threshold to obtain clusters of species.\n\n Important considerations:\n\n - **Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm**: We need to implement or use an existing implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. We are given a substitution matrix (swapping scores) and we also need to set gap penalties (which we don\'t have in the description). We must clarify the gap penalty. For now, we can assume linear gap penalty (constant gap extension) and we\'ll need the gap opening penalty. Alternatively, we can have a constant gap penalty for simplicity if not specified.\n\n - **Substitution Matrix**: We are given a predefined dictionary of swapping scores. We\'ll need to use that in the alignment.\n\n - **Distance Conversion**: After getting the alignment score for a pair, we need to convert it to a distance. One common way is to use:\n        distance = 1 - (score / max_possible_score)\n   However, the max_possible_score for a pair of sequences is not trivial because it depends on the lengths and the substitution matrix. Alternatively, we can use the maximum score of the two sequences aligned with themselves? But that might be biased. Another way is to use the raw score and then use a distance that is the negative of the score? But that might not be normalized. We must be cautious.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the alignment score to compute a normalized similarity (e.g., by dividing by the length of the alignment or the minimum/maximum of the two sequences) and then convert to distance. However, the problem does not specify. We will need to make a decision.\n\n   Since the problem says "calculate the similarity", we can take the alignment score as the similarity. Then we can convert to a distance by: \n        distance = max_score - similarity\n   But what is max_score? It could be the maximum possible alignment score for the two sequences? That is complex to compute.\n\n   Another approach: we can use the alignment score and then define the distance as:\n        distance = -log( (score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score) )\n   but that is more complex.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the normalized similarity defined as:\n        normalized_similarity = 2 * score / (score_seq1 + score_seq2)\n   where score_seq1 is the score when aligning the sequence with itself? Then distance = 1 - normalized_similarity.\n\n   However, we must be consistent. Since the problem does not specify, I propose:\n\n        similarity_score = alignment score from Needleman-Wunsch\n        Then, we define a distance between two sequences A and B as:\n            distance(A, B) = (max_self_score - similarity_score) / max_self_score\n        where max_self_score = max(score(A, A), score(B, B))\n\n   But note: score(A, A) is the alignment of A with itself, which should be the maximum for A? Actually, it would be the sum of the substitution matrix scores for each amino acid in A with itself? And then we take the maximum of the two? Or we can use the average? Or we can use the maximum possible score for the pair? \n\n   Alternatively, we can use the identity percentage? \n\n   However, to keep it simple and because we are going to build a tree, we can use the raw alignment score and then let the tree building method handle it? But tree building methods require distances (non-negative, zero when same). \n\n   Actually, we can define the distance as:\n        distance(A, B) = 1 - (similarity_score / sqrt(score(A,A) * score(B,B)))\n   which is similar to cosine similarity? \n\n   But I think a more standard way in bioinformatics is to use the "percent identity" and then convert to distance by a model (like Jukes-Cantor) but that is for nucleotides and for amino acids we might use a model? However, the problem does not specify.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we will start by using the raw alignment score as a similarity and then convert to distance by:\n\n        distance = 1 - (score / max(score_A, score_B))\n\n   where score_A is the alignment score of sequence A with itself? Actually, that would be:\n\n        score_A = align(A, A, substitution_matrix)\n        score_B = align(B, B, substitution_matrix)\n\n        Then normalized_score = score / max(score_A, score_B)\n\n        distance = 1 - normalized_score\n\n   This ensures that the distance between A and A is 0.\n\n   However, note: the alignment score of A with itself might be high, but what if we align A with a very similar sequence? Then the score might be close to score_A? Then the normalized_score would be near 1? and the distance near 0.\n\n   But what if the two sequences are of different lengths? Then the max(score_A, score_B) would be the score of the longer sequence with itself? Then the normalized_score for a short sequence aligned with a long one might be low? That might be acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the average of the two self-scores? \n\n   We\'ll go with:\n\n        distance(A, B) = 1 - (score_AB / sqrt(score_AA * score_BB))\n\n   This is similar to the normalized dot product (cosine similarity) but for alignment scores? \n\n   However, let me check: the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm produces a score that is the sum of substitution scores and gap penalties. There is no inherent normalization. Therefore, we need to normalize. \n\n   We\'ll use:\n\n        similarity = score_AB / sqrt(score_AA * score_BB)\n\n        distance = 1 - similarity\n\n   This will be in [0, 1] when the substitution matrix is such that the score_AB is at most sqrt(score_AA * score_BB). But note: by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, if we were to represent the sequences as vectors of substitution scores, this would hold. However, the alignment is not a linear operation. So it\'s an approximation.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the maximum of the two self-scores? \n\n   Given the complexity, I propose we start with:\n\n        distance = 1 - (score_AB / max(score_AA, score_BB))\n\n   because it is simpler and will give a value in [0,1] (if score_AB <= max(score_AA, score_BB), which should be the case because aligning two sequences cannot yield a score higher than the maximum of the two self-alignments? Actually, no: if we have two sequences that are identical and long, then score_AB might be the same as score_AA and score_BB? But if they are different, then it will be less.\n\n   However, what if we have a substitution matrix that gives a higher score for mismatches? Then the self-alignment might not be the maximum? But typically substitution matrices (like BLOSUM) give the highest score for matching the same amino acid.\n\n   So we\'ll assume that the substitution matrix is such that the highest score for an amino acid is when it matches itself.\n\n   Therefore, we\'ll use:\n\n        distance = 1 - (score_AB / max(score_AA, score_BB))\n\n   But note: the self-alignment score_AA is computed by aligning the sequence with itself. This will have no gaps? So we must set the gap penalty to avoid gaps in self-alignment? Actually, we can set the gap penalty to be negative so that gaps are penalized. Then the self-alignment without gaps will be the maximum.\n\n   We must be cautious: we are going to use the same gap penalty for all alignments.\n\n   Steps for the project:\n\n   Step 1: Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a given substitution matrix and gap penalty (we need to set the gap penalty, which is not provided). We\'ll have to ask for the gap penalty or set a default (e.g., -10).\n\n   Step 2: Compute the pairwise distance matrix for all species.\n\n        For each species i and j:\n            score_ij = align(seq_i, seq_j, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n            score_ii = align(seq_i, seq_i, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n            score_jj = align(seq_j, seq_j, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n            distance[i, j] = 1 - (score_ij / max(score_ii, score_jj))\n\n        But note: we don\'t need to compute the self-alignments for every pair? We can precompute the self-alignments for each species once.\n\n   Step 3: Build a distance matrix (symmetric) of size n x n, where n is the number of species.\n\n   Step 4: Use the distance matrix to build a phylogenetic tree (using UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining). Since we want a dendrogram, UPGMA is straightforward and produces an ultrametric tree (which is suitable for dendrogram with a uniform time scale). However, if the molecular clock assumption is not valid, Neighbor-Joining might be better. We\'ll start with UPGMA for simplicity.\n\n   Step 5: Visualize the tree as a dendrogram.\n\n   Step 6: Implement a function to cut the tree at a given threshold to get clusters.\n\n Outline of the code:\n\n 1. Implement `needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)`: returns the alignment score.\n\n 2. Precompute the self-alignment scores for each sequence.\n\n 3. Compute the distance matrix.\n\n 4. Implement UPGMA clustering (which will build the tree).\n\n 5. Use scipy or matplotlib to draw the dendrogram? We can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for UPGMA and dendrogram.\n\n 6. For clustering at a threshold, we can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster` to get clusters at a given threshold.\n\n However, note: we are to build a phylogenetic tree and then represent it as a dendrogram. The UPGMA algorithm is available in `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with method=\'average\'. But note: the UPGMA method is called \'average\' in scipy? Actually, the method \'average\' in scipy is the UPGMA? \n\n   - UPGMA: Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean -> which is the same as average linkage.\n\n   So we can use:\n\n        from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram, fcluster\n\n   Steps with scipy:\n\n        Z = linkage(distance_matrix, method=\'average\')\n        # then we can plot dendrogram\n        dendrogram(Z, labels=species_labels)\n\n   And for clustering at threshold t:\n\n        clusters = fcluster(Z, t, criterion=\'distance\')\n\n   However, note: the distance matrix we computed is a squareform distance matrix? We can use `scipy.spatial.distance.squareform` if we have a condensed distance vector? But the `linkage` function requires a condensed distance matrix (upper triangle as a vector). \n\n   Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform\n        condensed_dist = squareform(distance_matrix)\n\n   But note: our distance_matrix is symmetric, and we can convert it to a condensed form (without the diagonal and the upper triangle).\n\n   Actually, `linkage` expects a condensed distance matrix (a 1-D array of size n*(n-1)/2). We can generate that by:\n\n        indices = np.triu_indices(n, k=1)\n        condensed_dist = distance_matrix[indices]\n\n   Or we can use `scipy.spatial.distance.squareform` to convert a square matrix to condensed.\n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the condensed distance vector directly without building the full matrix? But for n species, we have to compute n*(n-1)/2 alignments.\n\n   We\'ll do:\n\n        n = len(sequences)\n        # Precompute self_scores: list of scores for each sequence with itself\n        self_scores = [needleman_wunsch(seq, seq, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty) for seq in sequences]\n\n        # Precompute the distance matrix as a full matrix (or we can compute a condensed vector directly)\n        dist_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                score_ij = needleman_wunsch(sequences[i], sequences[j], substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n                # Normalize and compute distance\n                max_self = max(self_scores[i], self_scores[j])\n                d = 1 - (score_ij / max_self)\n                dist_matrix[i, j] = d\n                dist_matrix[j, i] = d\n\n        # Then convert to condensed form for linkage? Actually, we can use:\n        # condensed_dist = dist_matrix[np.triu_indices(n, k=1)]\n\n        # But note: the linkage function expects a condensed distance matrix (the vector of the upper triangle). We can generate it without building the full matrix? We could avoid the full matrix by storing in a list.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can avoid building the full matrix by building the condensed vector directly:\n\n        condensed_dist = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                score_ij = needleman_wunsch(sequences[i], sequences[j], substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n                max_self = max(self_scores[i], self_scores[j])\n                d = 1 - (score_ij / max_self)\n                condensed_dist.append(d)\n\n        Then:\n            Z = linkage(condensed_dist, method=\'average\')\n\n   However, the Needleman-Wunsch is O(n*m) for two sequences of length n and m, and we have to do it for O(n^2) pairs. This might be slow for many sequences. We must note that.\n\n 7. We\'ll structure the code into functions:\n\n        - needleman_wunsch(seq1, seq2, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n        - compute_distance_matrix(sequences, substitution_matrix, gap_penalty)\n            returns condensed_dist and labels? or full matrix? We\'ll return the condensed distance vector and the labels for the sequences.\n\n        Then use scipy for the rest.\n\n 8. We\'ll need to visualize the dendrogram.\n\n 9. We\'ll need a function to get clusters at a threshold.\n\n However, note: the problem says "draw a dendrogram representing this tree". We can use `dendrogram` from scipy and then plot with matplotlib.\n\n 10. For the substitution matrix: we are given a dictionary. The dictionary might look like: \n        { (\'A\',\'A\'): 10, (\'A\',\'R\'): -1, ... }\n\n     We can also use a matrix representation? But we\'ll use the dictionary.\n\n Implementation of Needleman-Wunsch:\n\n        We\'ll create a DP table of size (len(seq1)+1) x (len(seq2)+1)\n\n        Initialization:\n            dp[0][0] = 0\n            for i in range(1, len(seq1)+1):\n                dp[i][0] = i * gap_penalty\n            for j in range(1, len(seq2)+1):\n                dp[0][j] = j * gap_penalty\n\n        Then for i from 1 to len(seq1):\n            for j from 1 to len(seq2):\n                match = dp[i-1][j-1] + substitution_matrix.get((seq1[i-1], seq2[j-1]), some_default)\n                delete = dp[i-1][j] + gap_penalty\n                insert = dp[i][j-1] + gap_penalty\n                dp[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)\n\n        Return dp[len(seq1)][len(seq2)]\n\n     But note: the gap_penalty is negative? So we are adding a negative number? Actually, we usually set gap_penalty as a negative number? But the problem says "swapping scores" which I assume are positive for good matches and negative for mismatches? And gap_penalty is negative? Then we are subtracting.\n\n     Alternatively, we can define the gap_penalty as a positive penalty and then subtract? But the algorithm is defined in terms of maximizing the score. So:\n\n        gap_penalty should be negative? Actually, we can use:\n\n            gap_penalty = -gap_open   (if we are using a constant gap penalty)\n\n        But the problem does not specify. We\'ll assume the gap_penalty is a negative number? Or we can design the function to take a gap_open (positive) and then subtract? We\'ll define:\n\n            gap_penalty = a negative number? \n\n        However, in the literature, the gap penalty is often a negative number. So we\'ll assume that the substitution matrix gives positive for matches and negative for mismatches and gaps, and we want to maximize the score.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a positive gap penalty and then subtract. Let me redefine:\n\n            We\'ll let the gap_penalty be a negative number? Or we can make it positive and then subtract? \n\n        We\'ll design the algorithm to take a gap_penalty that is a negative number? But then the initialization:\n\n            dp[0][0] = 0\n            dp[i][0] = i * gap_penalty   (which becomes negative)\n\n        Then when we add the gap_penalty, we are subtracting?

## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are given two input files:\n  1. organisms.json: a JSON file mapping species names (string) to amino acid sequences (string).\n  2. blosumXX.json: a JSON file (either blosum50.json or blosum62.json) that contains the substitution scores. The keys are either:\n        - single character (e.g., \'a\'): representing the cost for deleting that amino acid (gap penalty for that specific amino acid? But note: typically, gap penalties are constant. However, in this description, it seems we have a gap penalty per amino acid. But wait, the problem says: "deleting \'a\' cost -1", meaning that the gap penalty is not constant? Actually, in standard Needleman-Wunsch, we have a constant gap penalty. However, here the gap penalty is amino acid specific? But note: the example also includes two-character keys for substitutions.\n\n However, note: the example shows keys for deletion: single character, and for substitution: two characters. But in the alignment, we have two sequences. How do we handle gaps?\n\n Important: The problem states that a single character key represents the cost of deleting that character. But note: in alignment, we have two sequences. When we have a gap in sequence A (meaning we are inserting a gap in A and taking a character from B), then we are effectively deleting that character from A? Or is it the cost for introducing a gap in either sequence? The problem says "deleting that character", so we can interpret:\n\n   - When aligning two sequences, if we have a gap in sequence A (so we are taking an amino acid from B and a gap in A), then we use the deletion cost for the amino acid in B? Or in A? Actually, the gap can be introduced in either sequence.\n\n However, in the standard Needleman-Wunsch, we have a linear gap penalty that is constant. Here, the gap penalty is dependent on the amino acid? But note: the example only gives a single letter key, meaning the cost of deleting that amino acid. But in alignment, when we have a gap, we are deleting an amino acid from one of the sequences. So:\n\n   - If we have a gap in sequence A (meaning we are skipping an amino acid in A and taking an amino acid in B), then we are effectively deleting the amino acid in A? But the gap penalty would then be the cost for that amino acid in A? Similarly, if we have a gap in B, we use the deletion cost for the amino acid in B.\n\n However, the problem does not specify whether the deletion cost is for the amino acid that is being skipped (i.e., the one that is present in the sequence where we are not taking it) or if it is for the one that we are aligning against? Actually, the problem says: "deleting that character", meaning that if we skip an amino acid, we pay the deletion cost for that specific amino acid.\n\n Therefore, we can define:\n   - When we introduce a gap in sequence A (i.e., we are skipping an amino acid \'x\' in A), then we pay the deletion cost for \'x\' (from the BLOSUM dictionary, key = \'x\').\n   - Similarly, for a gap in sequence B (skipping an amino acid \'y\' in B), we pay the deletion cost for \'y\'.\n\n But note: the problem says "deleting that character", and in the example, the deletion cost for \'a\' is -1. So if we skip an \'a\', we get a penalty of -1.\n\n However, there is a problem: the deletion cost is amino acid specific. This is non-standard. Typically, gap penalties are constant. But we are constrained by the provided data.\n\n Steps for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm:\n\n   Let S1 and S2 be two sequences of length n and m.\n   We create a matrix D of size (n+1) x (m+1).\n\n   Initialization:\n     D[0][0] = 0\n     D[i][0] = sum of deletion costs for the first i amino acids of S1 (if we skip all of them, we are introducing gaps in S1 for the entire prefix) -> but wait, we are introducing gaps in S1 for the first i characters? Actually, we are aligning the prefix of S1 of length i to a gap sequence of length i. So for each amino acid in S1[0..i-1], we pay the deletion cost for that amino acid.\n\n     Similarly, D[0][j] = sum of deletion costs for the first j amino acids of S2.\n\n   Recurrence:\n     For each cell (i, j) (i from 1 to n, j from 1 to m):\n        match_score = D[i-1][j-1] + substitution_cost(S1[i-1], S2[j-1])\n        gap_in_S1 = D[i][j-1] + deletion_cost(S2[j-1])   # because we are taking S2[j-1] and skipping in S1 -> so we are deleting the amino acid in S1? Actually, no: we are introducing a gap in S1 and taking S2[j-1]. But the problem says the deletion cost is for the amino acid that is skipped? However, in this case, we are skipping an amino acid in S1? But we don\'t have an amino acid in S1 at this position? Actually, we are aligning S2[j-1] with a gap. The gap is introduced in S1. So the cost should be the deletion cost for the amino acid in S2? Or in S1? \n\n     Let me clarify: \n        - If we are aligning S1[i-1] with a gap (meaning we skip S1[i-1] and take a gap), then we are deleting S1[i-1]. So the cost for that gap is deletion_cost(S1[i-1]).\n        - Similarly, if we are aligning a gap with S2[j-1] (skip S2[j-1] and take a gap), then we are deleting S2[j-1], so cost = deletion_cost(S2[j-1]).\n\n     However, in the recurrence, when we are at (i, j):\n        Option1: Align S1[i-1] with S2[j-1] -> D[i-1][j-1] + sub(S1[i-1], S2[j-1])\n        Option2: Align S1[i-1] with a gap -> that means we are deleting S1[i-1] -> cost = D[i-1][j] + deletion_cost(S1[i-1])\n        Option3: Align a gap with S2[j-1] -> deleting S2[j-1] -> cost = D[i][j-1] + deletion_cost(S2[j-1])\n\n     But note: the example of the gap_in_S1 above was written as: \n          gap_in_S1 = D[i][j-1] + deletion_cost(S2[j-1])\n        This would be if we are at (i, j) and we come from the left (meaning we are taking S2[j-1] and a gap in S1). However, in this move, we are introducing a gap in S1 and taking S2[j-1]. The gap in S1 means we are skipping the current amino acid in S1? Actually, no: the current amino acid in S1 is at position i-1, but we are not skipping it in this move. We are skipping an amino acid in S1? Actually, we are at (i, j): we haven\'t used the i-th amino acid in S1? We are using the j-th amino acid in S2 (which is at index j-1). And we are aligning it with a gap in S1. But note: the gap in S1 doesn\'t correspond to any specific amino acid in S1? Actually, we are not skipping an amino acid in S1? We are just inserting a gap. However, the problem says: the deletion cost for an amino acid is the cost for deleting that amino acid. So when we insert a gap in S1, we are effectively not deleting an amino acid in S1? We are just leaving it unaligned? Actually, the deletion cost is applied when we skip an amino acid in one sequence.\n\n     How is the gap penalty applied in the recurrence? In the standard algorithm, we have:\n        gap_penalty = constant\n\n     Here, we have a gap penalty that depends on the amino acid in the sequence that we are taking? Actually, the problem says: \n        "deleting that character" meaning that if we delete an amino acid (i.e., skip it in the alignment and leave it unaligned), we pay the cost for that specific amino acid.\n\n     However, in the alignment, when we have a gap in one sequence, we are not deleting an amino acid from the other sequence? We are just aligning an amino acid from one sequence with a gap. The amino acid that is aligned with the gap is still present in its sequence? \n\n     I think there might be a confusion in terminology. Let me re-read: \n        "a single character key represents the cost of deleting that character"\n\n     So if we delete a character (i.e., we remove it and do not align it to anything), we pay the cost. In the alignment, when we have a gap in one sequence, we are effectively deleting the amino acid in the other sequence? Actually, no: we are aligning an amino acid from one sequence with a gap. The amino acid that is aligned with the gap is still present? \n\n     Actually, in the alignment, we are not deleting any amino acid. We are just introducing a gap. The problem might mean that the gap penalty is the cost for introducing a gap when aligning against a particular amino acid? But the problem states: "deleting that character", so it is associated with the amino acid that is being skipped? \n\n     Since the problem is ambiguous, I will stick to the recurrence as described in the example:\n\n        Option2: Align S1[i-1] with a gap -> then we are skipping S1[i-1] (we are not matching it with anything) and we pay the deletion cost for S1[i-1] (which is the value in the BLOSUM dictionary for the key = S1[i-1]).\n        Similarly, Option3: Align a gap with S2[j-1] -> pay deletion cost for S2[j-1].\n\n     Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n        D[i][j] = max(\n            D[i-1][j-1] + sub(S1[i-1], S2[j-1]), \n            D[i-1][j] + deletion_cost(S1[i-1]), \n            D[i][j-1] + deletion_cost(S2[j-1])\n        )\n\n     But note: the standard algorithm uses a constant gap penalty. Here, we have two types of gap penalties: one for skipping an amino acid in S1 and one for skipping in S2, and they are amino acid specific.\n\n   Also note: the substitution cost for two amino acids a and b is given by the key = a+b? Or b+a? The example has both "ab" and "ba" with the same cost? Actually, the example shows: \n        "ab": -3, "ba": -3\n\n     So it seems symmetric? But the problem says: "swapping \'a\' for \'b\' or \'b\' for \'a\' cost -3". Therefore, we can use the key in any order? Actually, the example has two keys: "ab" and "ba". But in the BLOSUM matrix, the cost for substituting a with b is the same as b with a. So we can use either key? However, the dictionary might have both? Then we have to be cautious.\n\n     The problem says: the key is two concatenated characters. So for two amino acids a and b, we have two possible keys: a+b and b+a. And the example shows both. So we should check for both? Or does the dictionary have both? The example does. But we don\'t know if the provided BLOSUM json will have both. We must be safe.\n\n     Actually, the problem says: "key is of type string and value is numerical". And the example includes both "ab" and "ba". So we must design to handle that? However, in the example, both keys have the same value. So for a pair (a, b), we can try:\n        key1 = a + b\n        key2 = b + a\n        If either key exists, we take the score? But what if both exist? They should be the same? Or we can take the first one we find? Actually, the problem doesn\'t specify. But note: the example dictionary has both.\n\n     Alternatively, we can note that the BLOSUM matrix is symmetric. So the score for (a,b) is the same as (b,a). Therefore, we can choose a canonical ordering (e.g., sort the two characters and then form the key? But the amino acids are represented by single letters and there is a canonical order? Actually, the BLOSUM matrix does not depend on the order. So we can do:\n\n        key = a + b   if we always use the first amino acid and then the second? But the dictionary might not have that.\n\n     Another idea: the problem states that the key is two concatenated characters. It does not specify the order. Therefore, we must check for both orders? But that is inefficient. Alternatively, we can preprocess the BLOSUM dictionary to create a new dictionary that maps a tuple (a, b) to the score. We can do:\n\n        For a given pair (a, b):\n          if the dictionary has key = a+b, use that.\n          else if it has key = b+a, use that.\n          else, what? The problem doesn\'t specify. But we should raise an error? Or use a default value? We must have a score for every pair.\n\n     However, the BLOSUM matrix should have an entry for every pair. And the example shows both orders. So we can assume that both orders are present? Then we can use:\n\n        score = blosum_dict.get(a+b)\n        if score is None:\n            score = blosum_dict.get(b+a)\n            if score is None:\n                # Then we have a problem: we don\'t have an entry for (a,b) or (b,a)\n                # We might use a default? But the problem doesn\'t specify. We should throw an error?\n\n     But note: the problem says the file is the BLOSUM table. So we expect it to be complete. We\'ll assume that at least one of the two keys is present. And if both are present, they should be the same? Actually, in the example, they are the same. So we can use either.\n\n     Alternatively, we can build a symmetric dictionary at the beginning to avoid checking both orders every time. We can preprocess the BLOSUM dictionary to create a dictionary that maps a frozenset of two characters? But wait, if we have two different amino acids, then the set {a, b} is the same as {b, a}. But what about the same amino acid? Then the set has one element. Actually, for same amino acid, the key is aa. So we can do:\n\n        For every key in the BLOSUM dictionary:\n          if len(key)==1: \n             it\'s a deletion cost, we keep it as is.\n          if len(key)==2:\n             we can create two entries: one for (key[0], key[1]) and one for (key[1], key[0])? But that would duplicate memory. Instead, we can create a function that, given two amino acids a and b, returns:\n                 if a==b: then we use the key = a+a? and look it up? \n                 else: try (a,b) and then (b,a)\n\n     But we don\'t need to precompute because we are going to do a lot of alignments? Actually, we are going to do O(n*m) for each pair of sequences. So we want the lookup to be fast. Precomputing a dictionary that maps the unordered pair (a,b) to the score? But note: the score for (a,b) is the same as (b,a). So we can create a dictionary with keys as tuples (min(a,b), max(a,b))? But then for same amino acid, (a,a) is the same. However, the same amino acid is already a single key: aa? Actually, the same amino acid is represented by a key of two same letters? So we can do:\n\n        key = a+b   if we want to try the order we have, but if not found, then try b+a.\n\n     Alternatively, we can preprocess the BLOSUM dictionary to create a new dictionary for pairs that is keyed by a tuple (a,b) but we store both orders? Actually, we can create a new dictionary for substitution scores that uses a normalized key: for two distinct amino acids, we can use the tuple (min(a,b), max(a,b))? But then we lose the ability to have asymmetric scores? But the problem says symmetric? Actually, the example is symmetric. And BLOSUM is symmetric.\n\n     However, to be safe, we\'ll do:\n\n        def get_substitution_score(a, b, blosum_dict):\n            key1 = a + b\n            key2 = b + a\n            if key1 in blosum_dict:\n                return blosum_dict[key1]\n            elif key2 in blosum_dict:\n                return blosum_dict[key2]\n            else:\n                # We could not find any key for (a, b) substitution\n                # This is an error? Or use a default? \n                # Since this is a critical error, we will raise an exception.\n                raise KeyError(f"Neither {key1} nor {key2} found in BLOSUM dictionary for substitution between {a} and {b}")\n\n     But note: the deletion cost is for a single amino acid. So for a single amino acid, we have:\n\n        deletion_cost(a) = blosum_dict[a]   # because the key is a single character.\n\n     However, we must be cautious: what if the BLOSUM dictionary does not have the deletion cost for an amino acid? Then we should also raise an error.\n\n Summary of requirements for the first task:\n\n  Input: \n    - organisms.json: dictionary {species: sequence}\n    - blosumXX.json: dictionary with keys of length 1 (deletion cost) and 2 (substitution cost)\n\n  We are to compute the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score for every pair of species.\n\n  Steps:\n\n    1. Load organisms.json -> a dictionary: species_names to sequences.\n    2. Load blosumXX.json -> a dictionary: we\'ll call it blosum.\n\n    3. For every pair of species (s1, s2) (without duplicating: since the score is symmetric? Actually, the alignment score for (s1, s2) is the same as (s2, s1) because the substitution is symmetric and the deletion cost is per amino acid?

## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to break down the task into several parts:\n 1. Reading the organisms.json file and the blosumXX.json file.\n 2. Implementing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment, using the provided BLOSUM matrix for substitution scores and gap penalties (which are given by single character keys in the BLOSUM JSON).\n 3. Calculating the alignment score for every pair of species (without duplication: i.e., for species A and B, we compute one score and store it such that we can access by (A, B) and (B, A) if needed, but note that the score is symmetric? Actually, the algorithm is symmetric? But we\'ll compute for every unordered pair once and then we can store in a structure that allows access by either order? However, to avoid redundant computation, we will compute for each unordered pair once and store in a symmetric matrix or dictionary with keys as (species1, species2) in sorted order to avoid duplication.\n\n Steps for the code structure:\n\n We\'ll create:\n - A module for reading the input files: `io_utils.py`\n - A module for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm: `alignment.py`\n - A main script that orchestrates the process: `compute_scores.py`\n\n Important: We are to store the scores in a structure for fast access. We can use a dictionary of dictionaries or a 2D array. But since the number of species might be large, and we will need to access the scores for clustering, we can store in a symmetric matrix (dictionary) where the key is a tuple of two species names (sorted) and the value is the score.\n\n However, note: the problem says "for each pair", meaning we need to compute for every unordered pair. We\'ll compute for each pair (i, j) with i < j and then store in a dictionary with key (min(i,j), max(i,j)).\n\n Steps in the main script:\n 1. Read organisms from `organisms.json`\n 2. Read the BLOSUM matrix from `blosumXX.json` (the exact filename will be provided by the user? We\'ll have to decide how the filename is specified. Since the instruction says that during one run only one type of BLOSUM is used, we can take the BLOSUM filename as a command-line argument or from a configuration? The problem does not specify. We\'ll assume that the BLOSUM filename is provided as an argument to the script.\n\n But note: the instruction says "Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used". So we can design the main script to take the BLOSUM filename as an argument.\n\n Alternatively, we can have the BLOSUM type (50 or 62) as an argument and then form the filename. However, the problem says the file is named "blosumXX.json". Let\'s assume we are passed the full filename.\n\n We\'ll design the main script to take two command-line arguments:\n   - The organisms JSON file (default: "organisms.json")\n   - The BLOSUM matrix JSON file (default: "blosum50.json" or we don\'t set default? We\'ll require it)\n\n However, the problem does not specify how the BLOSUM file is provided. We\'ll design to take the BLOSUM filename as a required argument.\n\n Alternatively, we can read from a fixed location? But the requirement says: "start all the paths from current directory". So we can take relative paths as arguments.\n\n We\'ll design:\n   `compute_scores.py` takes two arguments:\n        -o or --organisms: path to organisms.json (default: "./organisms.json")\n        -b or --blosum: path to the BLOSUM json file (required)\n\n 3. Then, we compute the score for every pair of species.\n\n We\'ll create a function in `alignment.py` that takes two sequences and the BLOSUM dictionary and returns the alignment score.\n\n Important: The BLOSUM dictionary has:\n   - Single character keys: gap penalty for that amino acid (actually, in the example, it\'s the cost for deleting that character, which is equivalent to a gap penalty). But note: in Needleman-Wunsch, we usually have a gap opening and gap extension? However, in the example, it\'s a linear gap penalty: same cost for every gap. So we\'ll use the single character key for the gap penalty.\n\n However, note: the example BLOSUM file has keys for single letters and two-letter combinations. The two-letter combinations are for substitutions. The single letter is for deleting that letter (which we interpret as a gap penalty when that letter is aligned with a gap). But note: the gap penalty is the same regardless of which amino acid is gapped? Actually, the example uses a single letter to represent the cost of deleting that letter. That means the gap penalty is dependent on the amino acid? This is non-standard. Typically, gap penalties are constant or affine.\n\n But the problem says: "deleting \'a\' cost -1". In the alignment, if we have a gap in one sequence, then we are effectively deleting a character from the other sequence. So when we have a gap in sequence A (meaning we are aligning a character from B with a gap), then we use the gap penalty for the character in B? Or vice versa? Actually, the deletion cost is for the character that is being deleted. So:\n\n   - If we align amino acid `a` from sequence A with a gap, then we use the gap penalty for `a` (which is the value for key "a" in BLOSUM: -1 in the example).\n   - Similarly, if we align a gap with amino acid `b` from sequence B, then we use the gap penalty for `b` (-2 in the example).\n\n However, note that the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is symmetric? Actually, the gap penalty for a gap in sequence A at a position (when sequence B has an amino acid) should be the same as a gap in sequence B when sequence A has an amino acid? But the example BLOSUM file assigns different gap penalties for different amino acids. So we have to use the gap penalty of the amino acid that is being gapped? That is, if we are inserting a gap in sequence A, then we are effectively deleting the amino acid in sequence B? Then we use the gap penalty for the amino acid in sequence B? Or the other way around? Actually, the problem states: "deleting \'a\' cost -1". So when we delete an amino acid (say, from sequence A) we use the gap penalty for that amino acid. But in the alignment matrix, when we are at position (i, j), if we introduce a gap in sequence A (so we skip i and take j), then we are deleting the amino acid at i in A? Then we should use the gap penalty for A[i]. Similarly, if we introduce a gap in sequence B, we are deleting the amino acid at j in B? Then we use the gap penalty for B[j].\n\n So the recurrence for the Needleman-Wunsch matrix M[i][j] is:\n\n   M[i][j] = max {\n        M[i-1][j-1] + subst_score(A[i], B[j]),   # match or mismatch\n        M[i-1][j] + gap_penalty(A[i]),            # gap in sequence B (so we are deleting A[i])\n        M[i][j-1] + gap_penalty(B[j])             # gap in sequence A (so we are deleting B[j])\n   }\n\n But note: the gap_penalty function is defined by the BLOSUM dictionary: for an amino acid `x`, the gap penalty is BLOSUM[x] (which is a negative number, meaning penalty).\n\n However, in the example, the gap penalties are negative, so adding them reduces the score. The substitution scores can be positive or negative.\n\n 4. We are required to output integer scores (no decimal points). The BLOSUM values are integers? The example shows integers. We\'ll assume they are integers.\n\n 5. We are given an example test case: \n        species1: "aabaab"\n        species2: "ababaa"\n        BLOSUM: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}\n        Expected score: 7.\n\n  Let\'s verify by hand (or by writing a small test) that our algorithm returns 7.\n\n Implementation details for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm:\n\n   Let A = "aabaab", B = "ababaa"\n\n   We\'ll create a matrix `dp` with dimensions (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1).\n\n   Initialization:\n        dp[0][0] = 0\n        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + gap_penalty(A[i-1])   [because for each gap in B at the beginning, we are deleting A[i-1]]\n        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + gap_penalty(B[j-1])   [because for each gap in A at the beginning, we are deleting B[j-1]]\n\n   Then for i from 1 to len(A) and j from 1 to len(B):\n        match = dp[i-1][j-1] + subst_score(A[i-1], B[j-1])\n        delete_in_A = dp[i][j-1] + gap_penalty(B[j-1])   # because we are introducing a gap in A, so we are deleting B[j-1]? Actually, wait: \n          - When we are at (i, j-1) and we move to (i, j), we are taking an extra character from B (j) and we are skipping it in A? So we are introducing a gap in A? Then we are aligning the gap in A with the amino acid B[j-1] (because our sequences are 0-indexed, and we are at the j-th character of B, which is at index j-1). So we use the gap penalty for B[j-1]? But note: the gap is in A, so we are deleting from A? Actually, no: we are not deleting any amino acid from A because we are at the same row (i) meaning we haven\'t advanced in A. We advanced in B and we are aligning that B character with a gap. So we are effectively deleting that B character? No, we are inserting a gap in A. The problem states: deleting a character (say from A) means that we skip it in A and we don\'t align it with anything. But in the alignment, we are aligning it with a gap. So the cost is the gap penalty for that amino acid? Actually, the problem says: "deleting \'a\' cost -1". So when we skip an amino acid (regardless of which sequence) we use the gap penalty for that amino acid.\n\n   However, note: the gap penalty depends on which amino acid is being skipped. In the recurrence, when we skip an amino acid in sequence A (by introducing a gap in A) then the gap penalty is for the amino acid in A at the position we are skipping? But in the above recurrence for the vertical move (gap in A) we are skipping the amino acid in A? Actually, no:\n\n        - The move from (i-1, j) to (i, j) is: we take A[i] and we skip B[j]? No, we take A[i] and we skip B[j]? Actually, we are moving vertically: we are at (i-1, j) and we move to (i, j): that means we are taking the next character from A (i) and we are skipping it? No, we are aligning A[i] with a gap? Then we are deleting A[i]? So we should use the gap penalty for A[i]. Similarly, when moving horizontally, we are aligning a gap in A with B[j]? Then we are deleting B[j]? So we use the gap penalty for B[j].\n\n   But note: in the initialization, when we build the first row (i=0, j from 1 to len(B)), we are having the entire sequence A is gaps? So we are aligning the prefix of B with gaps. Then we are deleting each character in B? So we use the gap penalty for B[j] for each j.\n\n   Similarly, in the first column, we are deleting each character in A.\n\n   Therefore, the recurrence:\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(\n            dp[i-1][j-1] + subst_score(A[i-1], B[j-1]),\n            dp[i-1][j] + gap_penalty(A[i-1]),   # because we are skipping A[i-1] (so we are deleting A[i-1]) and we are aligning it with a gap? Actually, at (i-1, j) we have aligned the first i-1 of A and j of B. Then we take the next character of A (at i-1) and we skip it? So we are deleting A[i-1]? Then we use the gap penalty for A[i-1]. But note: we are at row i, which corresponds to having processed i characters of A. The amino acid at position i-1 in A is the one we are about to skip? Actually, we are at the state after having processed i characters of A and j characters of B. Then the move from (i-1, j) to (i, j) means we are processing the i-th character of A (which is at index i-1) and we are aligning it with a gap? Then we are deleting that character? So we use the gap penalty for that character.\n\n        dp[i][j-1] + gap_penalty(B[j-1])   # similarly, we are processing the j-th character of B (index j-1) and aligning it with a gap.\n\n   However, wait: in the horizontal move, we are at (i, j-1) and we move to (i, j): we are processing the j-th character of B (index j-1) and we are aligning it with a gap? Then we are deleting that B character? So we use the gap penalty for B[j-1].\n\n   But note: the example does not specify whether the gap penalty is applied to the sequence that has the amino acid or the sequence that has the gap? The problem says: "deleting \'a\' cost -1", so regardless of which sequence the amino acid is from, if we delete it, we use the gap penalty for that amino acid.\n\n   Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(\n            dp[i-1][j-1] + subst_score(A[i-1], B[j-1]),\n            dp[i-1][j] + gap_penalty(A[i-1]),\n            dp[i][j-1] + gap_penalty(B[j-1])\n        )\n\n   Now, let\'s test the example:\n\n        A = "aabaab", B = "ababaa"\n\n        We need the BLOSUM dictionary:\n\n            gap_penalty(\'a\') = -1\n            gap_penalty(\'b\') = -2\n            subst_score(\'a\',\'a\') = 2\n            subst_score(\'a\',\'b\') = -3   [because key "ab" is -3? But note the example also has "ba":-3, so symmetric? We\'ll assume that the substitution is symmetric: so the key for substitution is the sorted pair? Actually, the example has keys "ab" and "ba" both set to -3. So we can use either? But the sequences use \'a\' and \'b\'. We should design: for two amino acids x and y, we form the key by the two characters in alphabetical order? But amino acids are not letters? Actually, we are using single letters. The example has keys as the concatenation of two letters? And it has both "ab" and "ba"? So we can try both? But the example says: swapping \'a\' for \'b\' or \'b\' for \'a\' cost -3. So we can use either key? However, the problem does not specify the order. We must be cautious.\n\n        How to get the substitution score for (x, y)? We can try:\n            key1 = x + y\n            key2 = y + x\n            if key1 in blosum: then use blosum[key1]\n            else if key2 in blosum: then use blosum[key2]\n            else: ??? \n\n        But the example BLOSUM has both "ab" and "ba". So it\'s redundant? Actually, the example has both. So we can use the key that exists? But note: the example says: "swapping \'a\' for \'b\' or \'b\' for \'a\' cost -3". So we can define:\n\n            if x == y:\n                key = x + y   # but in the example, they have "aa" and "bb", so we can use that.\n            else:\n                # we have two keys: "ab" and "ba", both present? But the problem does not guarantee that both are present? Actually, the example has both. However, to be safe, we can try both orders? But the problem says: the key is two concatenated characters. It doesn\'t specify the order.\n\n        Alternatively, we can form the key by the two characters in sorted order? That would be consistent. Then for (x,y) we form the key = \'\'.join(sorted([x,y])). But then for \'a\' and \'b\', sorted gives "ab", which is in the dictionary? But what if the two amino acids are the same? Then sorted gives "aa", which is also in the dictionary.\n\n        But note: the example BLOSUM has "aa", "bb", "ab", "ba". So we can use the sorted key? However, the problem does not specify that the keys are sorted. But in the example, both "ab" and "ba" are present and have the same value. So we can use:\n\n            if x == y:\n                key = x + x\n            else:\n                key = min(x, y) + max(x, y)\n\n        Then we look up that key.\n\n        However, the example also has "ba", which is not the sorted order? But if we form the sorted key, we get "ab" for both (a,b) and (b,a). And in the example, "ab" is present? Actually, the example dictionary has both "ab" and "ba". So we can use the sorted key and then if that key is not present, we try the reverse? But that might be inefficient. Alternatively, we can preprocess the BLOSUM dictionary to create a new substitution dictionary that maps a tuple (x,y) to the score? We can do:\n\n            We\'ll build a substitution matrix dictionary that is indexed by (x,y) and we precompute:\n\n            for each key in the BLOSUM dictionary:\n                if len(key) == 1: we skip (because that\'s a gap penalty)\n                if len(key) == 2:\n                    x = key[0'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 1703, 'total_tokens': 5799, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 1408}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 1408, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 295}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'b94d4322-02c3-43d0-9d82-cf6056e94205', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--8224351c-a66e-461e-938b-0cbf693a6dbb-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1703, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 5799, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 1408}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Code Modification Summary:**  
Added functionality to save computed Needleman-Wunsch scores to a JSON file with dynamically generated filename based on the BLOSUM matrix used. The output file follows the pattern `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` and stores scores in a flattened key-value structure (e.g., `{"Wild boar_Horse": 42}`).

**Key Changes:**
1. Added `os` import to parse BLOSUM filename
2. Converted nested scores dictionary to flat structure with `{species1}_{species2}` keys
3. Generated output filename dynamically from input BLOSUM file
4. Saved results with indentation for readability

## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are moving to the second task: building a phylogenetic tree from the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.\n\nKey points from the instruction:\n1. We have previously calculated similarity scores (from the first task) stored in a JSON file (organisms_scores_blosumXX.json). The scores are similarities (higher is better) and are integers.\n2. We need to build a phylogenetic tree using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering (bottom-up) approach. The method is similar to single linkage, but we are using similarity (so we want to merge the most similar pairs first).\n3. Most libraries operate on distances (dissimilarities). Therefore, we must convert our similarity scores to distances appropriately. Since higher similarity means closer, we can convert by:\n   - Option: Using a transformation such as distance = (max_similarity - similarity) to get non-negative distances. However, note that the maximum similarity might not be known in advance and might be different for different runs. Alternatively, we can use negative similarities as distances? But then we have negative distances which are problematic.\n   - Alternatively, we can use the similarity scores directly but in a way that the algorithm knows that higher similarity means closer. The `linkage` function in `scipy` for example expects distances (so lower is closer). Therefore, we can convert the similarity to distance by: distance = max_score - score, where max_score is the maximum similarity in the matrix. This ensures that the pair with the highest similarity becomes the pair with the smallest distance.\n\n4. We have to be cautious because later steps will require:\n   - Generating clusters at different thresholds (which are in the original similarity score range). So we must preserve the original similarity scores in the tree structure? Or at least have a way to relate the tree nodes to the original scores.\n   - The tree must be saved in Newick format for visualization and further processing.\n   - We will also need to draw a dendrogram.\n\n5. The clustering method: single linkage. But note: the instruction says "single linkage methodology", but we are merging based on highest similarity. In single linkage for distances, we take the minimum distance between clusters. For similarities, we would take the maximum similarity between clusters? Actually, the concept is the same: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two members (one from each cluster). Then we merge the clusters with the highest similarity.\n\nPlan for the code:\n- Read the similarity scores from the JSON file. The file has keys like "species1_species2" and the similarity score.\n- We need to convert this into a condensed distance matrix (for use with `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`). But note: the linkage function expects a condensed distance matrix (upper triangle) of the distance matrix. We have a similarity matrix and we need to convert to a distance matrix.\n\nSteps:\n1. Load the scores from the JSON file and reconstruct the full square matrix of similarities for the species. But note: the previous JSON file saved by the first task is in a flattened form (with keys "org1_org2"). We have to map the species names to indices.\n\n2. Convert similarity to distance. Since we are going to use single linkage (which uses the minimum distance between clusters) and we want the highest similarity to become the smallest distance, we can do:\n   Let S be the similarity matrix. Then distance matrix D = max(S) - S, but note that max(S) is the maximum value in the entire matrix? Then we set D_ij = max_similarity - S_ij. This way, the pair with the highest similarity becomes 0 distance and others are positive.\n\n   However, note: the linkage algorithm merges the two clusters with the smallest distance. So by this transformation, the pair with the highest similarity will have the smallest distance (0) and will be merged first.\n\n3. But wait: the instruction says that we are using single linkage. However, in phylogenetics, there are various methods (UPGMA, neighbor joining, etc.). The instruction says "agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage", so we are using single linkage (which in phylogenetics is also known as the nearest neighbor method).\n\n4. We will use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with method=\'single\'. But note: the input must be a condensed distance matrix (1D array of size n*(n-1)//2). We have to create that from the full distance matrix (which we converted from similarity).\n\n5. After building the linkage matrix, we can:\n   a. Generate clusters at different thresholds (in terms of the original similarity). But note: the linkage matrix uses the distance (which we transformed). So when we want to cut the tree at a similarity threshold, we have to convert the threshold to the distance scale: distance_threshold = max_similarity - similarity_threshold.\n\n   However, the dendrogram drawing and Newick tree will need to use the original similarity for the branch lengths? Or should we store the original similarity in the tree? The problem: the linkage algorithm produces a tree where the heights (distances) are in the transformed distance scale. But the instruction says that later steps will use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores.\n\n   We have two options:\n   Option 1: Build the tree using the transformed distances, but then when saving the Newick tree, convert the distances back to similarities? But note: the tree is built on distances. The branch lengths in the tree are in the distance unit. However, the instruction does not specify that the branch lengths must be the original similarity. It only says that we will use the tree for clustering at similarity thresholds.\n\n   For clustering: when we cut the tree at a distance threshold `d`, that corresponds to a similarity threshold `s = max_similarity - d`. So if we are given a similarity threshold `s`, we set `d = max_similarity - s` and then cut the tree at distance `d`.\n\n   But note: the dendrogram drawing function (in matplotlib) will use the distance (transformed) for the heights. We might want to relabel the axis to show similarity? That can be done by inverting the axis? Or we can change the tick labels? Alternatively, we can store the original similarity at each merge? That might be complicated.\n\n   Option 2: Instead of transforming the similarity to distance by subtracting from the maximum, we can use negative similarities? But then we might get negative distances and the linkage algorithm might not work.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a different transformation: set the distance to 1/(similarity) or something? But that would change the relative relationships.\n\n   Given the constraints, I think the standard way is to use: distance = max_similarity - similarity. We store the max_similarity so that we can convert back when needed.\n\n6. Steps for the code:\n   - Read the JSON file of scores (organisms_scores_blosumXX.json).\n   - Extract the list of unique species. Let n = number of species.\n   - Create a matrix (n x n) of similarities. Initialize with zeros? But note: the similarity of a species to itself is not stored? We can assume that the self-similarity is the maximum? Actually, we don\'t need the diagonal for the condensed matrix. But we have to fill the matrix for all pairs.\n\n   How to get the max_similarity? We can take the maximum value in the entire matrix? But note: the matrix is symmetric and we have all pairs.\n\n   However, the self-pairs are not included in the JSON? And we don\'t need them for the clustering (because we don\'t cluster a species with itself). So we can compute max_similarity = max(all the scores in the JSON).\n\n   Then create a distance matrix: for each pair (i, j), distance[i,j] = max_similarity - similarity[i,j]. Note: this makes the distance matrix symmetric and zeros on the diagonal? Actually, we don\'t set the diagonal because we are going to use the condensed form (which doesn\'t include the diagonal).\n\n   Then convert the full distance matrix to condensed form (only the upper triangle, as a 1D array of length n*(n-1)//2).\n\n   Then call: `linkage(condensed_dist, method=\'single\')`\n\n   Then we can:\n      - Save the tree in Newick format (using `to_tree` and then a recursive function to write Newick).\n      - Draw a dendrogram (using `dendrogram` function) and save the figure.\n\n   But note: the instruction says that we will need to do these in later steps. So for now, we are just building the tree and saving it in a structure that can be used later? Or we are to write the Newick now? The instruction says: "in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format". So we might not do the drawing now? We are only building the tree structure and saving the linkage for later? Or we are to create a module that can output the Newick when required?\n\n   Since the instruction is for the second task, and it says "build a phylogenetic tree", we should at least build the tree and save it in a format that can be used for Newick and dendrogram later. We can save the linkage matrix and the labels? Then in a separate task, we will write the Newick and draw the dendrogram.\n\n   However, the instruction says: "This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology." and then mentions that we must be aware of the similarity scores for later. So the immediate task is to build the tree (linkage matrix) and save it? Or the entire tree structure?\n\n   We are told that we will need to generate clusters for different thresholds and also save the tree in Newick. Therefore, we should design a module that:\n      - Builds the tree (linkage) from the similarity scores.\n      - Saves the linkage matrix and the labels (species names) for later use.\n\n   But note: the linkage matrix is a numpy array. We can save it in a file (e.g., .npy) or we can save it in a text file? Also, we need to save the max_similarity because we will need it to convert the distance thresholds to similarity thresholds? Actually, for cutting the tree, we can convert the threshold (which is in similarity) to distance. So we need to remember max_similarity.\n\n   Alternatively, we can save the max_similarity along with the linkage matrix and labels.\n\n   However, the instruction says: "these scores will be later used for other algorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access". We already saved the scores in a JSON. Now we are building the tree. So for the tree, we need to save the tree structure? The linkage matrix is the tree structure.\n\n   Proposed output for this task:\n      - A function that reads the scores JSON, builds the linkage matrix (and records max_similarity and the list of species), and then saves the linkage matrix and the labels and max_similarity in a file (e.g., in a pickle? or in a JSON?).\n\n   But the requirement says: production ready. We should avoid pickle for portability. We can save the linkage matrix as a nested list in JSON? The linkage matrix is (n-1) x 4. We can save it as a list of lists, and then also save the labels and max_similarity.\n\n   However, the next task might be to generate the Newick tree. We can compute the Newick from the linkage matrix and the labels. So we can write a function that does that.\n\n   So for now, the second task is:\n      - Read the scores from the JSON file (for a given BLOSUM version, so we have to know which one was used?).\n      - Build the linkage matrix (after converting to distance) and record max_similarity and the species list (labels).\n      - Save the linkage matrix, labels, and max_similarity in a JSON file? Or multiple files? We can save in a single JSON file: \n          {\n            "max_similarity": 1000,\n            "labels": ["species1", "species2", ...],\n            "linkage": [[...], ...]   # (n-1) x 4\n          }\n\n   Then, in a later task, we can load this and generate the Newick tree and dendrogram.\n\n   But note: the dendrogram function in scipy can be called with the linkage matrix and labels. So we have to save the linkage matrix and labels.\n\n   Also, the instruction says: "I will be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds". We can use `fcluster` from scipy with the distance threshold (which we convert from similarity threshold). We also need the max_similarity for that conversion.\n\n   Therefore, we will save:\n        max_similarity: int\n        labels: list of species names (in the order they were in the distance matrix)\n        linkage_matrix: list of lists (each inner list has 4 numbers: [cluster_i, cluster_j, distance, count])\n\n   We can save this in a JSON file? But note: the linkage matrix has floats? We can convert to integers? The distance we computed is an integer? Because max_similarity and the scores are integers. So the distance matrix is integers. Then the linkage matrix (for single linkage) will also be integers? Not necessarily: during the merging, the algorithm might average and get floats? Actually, single linkage uses the minimum distance, which is an integer. So the entire linkage matrix should be integers? But the `linkage` function returns floats. We can save as floats? Or we can round? But we should not lose precision.\n\n   Alternatively, we can save the linkage matrix as a list of lists of floats? JSON supports that.\n\n   The file name: we are using the same BLOSUM matrix? So we can name it: `linkage_blosumXX.json`\n\n   Steps for the code of task 2:\n\n   1. Read the scores from `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` (the same one that was saved in task 1).\n   2. Extract the list of species: we can get the unique species by splitting the keys? But note: the keys are of the form "species1_species2". But wait: in the first task, we saved the scores in a nested dictionary? Actually, we changed it to a flattened dictionary? Yes, in the first task we saved as: \n        { "Wild boar_Horse": 42, ... }\n\n   3. How to get the list of species? We can split every key by \'_\' and then take the union? But note: the keys are for every pair. We can do:\n\n        species = set()\n        for key in scores_flattened:\n            parts = key.split(\'_\')\n            # But note: the key might have underscores in the species name? \n            # This is a problem: we assumed that the species names do not contain underscores? \n\n   We have a problem: if the species name contains an underscore, then splitting by \'_\' will break it.\n\n   We must change the way we store the keys? But the first task is already done. Alternatively, we can store the species list in a separate file? Or we can note that the set of species can be reconstructed by taking all the parts? But then we have to merge the parts that belong to the same species? This is error-prone.\n\n   Alternatively, we can change the first task? But the first task is already implemented and we are in the second task.\n\n   We have two options:\n      a. Change the first task to save the species list separately? But the instruction for the first task is already implemented and we are moving forward.\n      b. In the first task, we had the organisms dictionary (which had all species). We didn\'t save that? We only saved the scores.\n\n   How about we save the list of species in the first task? We didn\'t. So now we are stuck with the flattened keys.\n\n   We must assume that the species names do not contain underscores? The example had "Wild boar" and "Horse", which don\'t have underscores. But if they do, we are in trouble.\n\n   Since the project is ongoing, and we are in the design phase, we can go back and change the first task? But the instruction for the second task is given.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store the species list in the same JSON file? We didn\'t. We only stored the pairs.\n\n   We can reconstruct the set of species by:\n\n        species = set()\n        for key in scores_flattened:\n            # We don\'t know how many parts? But each key is two species separated by an underscore? \n            # How many underscores are in the species names? We don\'t know.\n\n   This is a flaw in the design of the first task.\n\n   We need to fix this. Since the project is in progress, we can modify the first task to save the species list? But the instruction for the second task has been given.\n\n   Alternatively, we can change the saving format in the first task to include the species list? But the requirement was to have a key-value structure with keys as "species1_species2". We met that. But now we are stuck.\n\n   We must ask the user: are the species names allowed to have underscores? But the instruction says we are acting as a senior developer. We should anticipate this.\n\n   However, the instruction for the second task is given and we must proceed.\n\n   We will assume that the species names do not contain underscores. Then we can split by \'_\' and take the two parts. Then the set of species is the union of all the first parts and all the second parts? But note: each key is a pair. The set of species is the union of all the parts? Actually, each key has exactly two species? Because we saved for each pair.\n\n   So:\n\n        species = set()\n        for key in scores_flattened:\n            parts = key.split(\'_\')\n            if len(parts) < 2:\n                # This should not happen, but skip\n                continue\n            # The key is two species? But what if there are multiple underscores? \n            # We assumed no underscores in the species name.\n\n   We\'ll assume that the species names have no underscores. Then we can split into exactly two parts? Not necessarily: the key might be "species1_species2", so two parts. So we can do:\n\n        species1 = \'_\'.join(parts[:-1])\n        species2 = parts[-1]\n\n   No, that doesn\'t work. Because we don\'t know how many parts. The problem is that we concatenated the two species names with an underscore without escaping.\n\n   We must change the first task to use a different separator? Or to store the pairs in a way that preserves the species names? \n\n   Given the time, we will proceed with the assumption that species names do not contain underscores. And we will note this as a limitation.\n\n   Steps for the second task code:\n\n   - Read the scores JSON (for a given BLOSUM version? How do we know which one? We can pass the BLOSUM type as an argument? Or the filename of the scores JSON? We\'ll design the function to take the filename of the scores JSON.\n\n   - Extract species by splitting keys and taking unique names.\n\n   - Create an index for each species.\n\n   - Build a full matrix'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3160, 'total_tokens': 7256, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 1856}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 1856, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 1304}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '751c4937-fc47-48c1-9bad-6da657b1dd40', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--98f70ded-4bf4-4b84-a998-8fd835ee150c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3160, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 7256, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 1856}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to build a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) with single linkage, but note: we are using similarity scores (higher is better) instead of distance (lower is better). Therefore, we need to convert the similarity scores to distances appropriately.\n\n However, note: the problem states that we must use the Needleman-Wunsch scores as similarity and that the merging is done starting from the most similar (highest score). In hierarchical clustering, we usually merge the closest (smallest distance). So we can convert the similarity to distance by:\n   distance = (max_similarity - similarity)   OR   distance = 1/similarity, but note that the scores can be negative.\n\n Alternatively, we can invert the similarity by taking negative: distance = -similarity. Then the highest similarity becomes the smallest distance (because -1200 is less than -1000). This way, the single linkage (minimum distance) will pick the pair with the highest similarity.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have a matrix of similarity scores for every pair. But note: our previous scores are stored in a nested dictionary (or a flattened one for the file). We need to create a distance matrix for the clustering algorithm.\n\n 2. We will use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for the clustering. The input is a condensed distance matrix (or a squareform). But note: we have to build a distance matrix from our similarity scores.\n\n 3. We have to assign a distance for each pair: distance = -similarity (so that higher similarity becomes lower distance).\n\n 4. We will use the `linkage` function with method=\'single\'. However, note that the problem says: "merge the most similar", and in single linkage we merge the two clusters with the smallest distance (which in our case is the highest similarity). This matches.\n\n 5. The linkage matrix will then be used to create a tree. We can then use `to_tree` from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` to get a tree node structure.\n\n 6. The height of each node in the dendrogram (which we will use for the tree) is the distance at which the clusters are merged. But note: we want to store the original similarity score as the height? Actually, the problem says: "the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200" (the similarity score). However, in the linkage process, the distance (which we set as -similarity) is used. So when we get the dendrogram, the height will be the distance (negative similarity). We must convert back to similarity for the node height? \n\n 7. Alternatively, we can adjust the tree after building: we can store the original similarity in the node. But note: the linkage algorithm uses the distance. The height in the dendrogram is the distance. We want the node to have the original similarity as height? Then we can set the height of the node as: (max_similarity - distance) but that might be complex. Actually, we set distance = -similarity, so similarity = -distance. Therefore, when we get the distance from the linkage, we can compute the similarity by -distance.\n\n 8. However, the problem says: "the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200". So we want the node to remember the similarity score (1200) at which the merge happened. We can create a custom tree node that stores the original similarity.\n\n 9. Alternatively, we can adjust the linkage matrix: the linkage matrix has the distances (which are negative of the similarity). We can then when plotting or when building the tree, we can convert back. But for the Newick format and for the cluster thresholds, we want to use the original similarity.\n\n 10. Let\'s plan: we will build the linkage with distances = -similarity. Then we will build a tree structure (using `to_tree`). Then we traverse the tree and for each node, we set the node\'s height (which we will store as the similarity) as - (the distance stored in the linkage node). Why? Because the linkage node\'s distance is the distance at which the merge happened (which is -similarity). So we take negative of that to get the similarity.\n\n 11. But note: the root node? The root node will have the largest distance (because it\'s the last merge) and then we convert to similarity: - (large positive) becomes a large negative? That doesn\'t make sense. Let me think: if two very similar species (say similarity 1200) are merged, the distance is -1200. The linkage algorithm will record the distance as 1200? No, wait: we set the distance to -1200? Then the linkage algorithm will see that as a very negative number, which is the smallest distance? Then the merge will happen at distance = -1200. Then when we convert back: similarity = - ( -1200) = 1200. That works.\n\n 12. However, the linkage algorithm does not allow negative distances? Actually, it does not require non-negativity? But the single linkage method can handle negative? We must check: the scipy documentation says: "The input y may be either a 1d condensed distance matrix or a 2d array of observation vectors. If y is a 1d condensed distance matrix, then y must be a \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\) sized vector where n is the number of original observations paired in the distance matrix." and it doesn\'t say non-negative. But in practice, the methods might assume non-negative? \n\n 13. Alternatively, we can shift the distances to be positive? We can do: \n        max_sim = max(all_similarities)\n        distance = max_sim - similarity   [then all distances are non-negative?]\n     But note: if we do that, then the most similar pair has the smallest distance (max_sim - high_similarity = small positive). However, then the height of the node in the dendrogram (distance) would be max_sim - similarity. But we want the node to store the original similarity? Then we can store it separately.\n\n 14. Considering the above, I propose:\n\n     Option A: Use negative distances and hope the algorithm works. The scipy linkage for single linkage might work because it only takes the minimum, and negative numbers are acceptable.\n\n     Option B: Instead of using the linkage matrix, we can implement the hierarchical clustering ourselves? But that would be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\n 15. After research: scipy\'s linkage with negative values: \n        "The hierarchical clustering algorithms in scipy.cluster.hierarchy are designed to work with any distance matrix, regardless of whether the distances are positive or negative. However, the results may be difficult to interpret if the distances are negative." \n     But we are going to interpret the distances by converting back to similarity. Also, the single linkage method (which uses the minimum distance) should work.\n\n 16. However, the problem says: "the tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor of all species". We can achieve that with the linkage.\n\n 17. Steps for the code:\n\n     a. Read the previously saved scores from "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json". But note: we are going to run the tree building separately? We are not going to recalc the scores? So we read the JSON file.\n\n     b. The JSON file has keys like "species1_species2" and the score. We need to create a distance matrix (with negative scores) for all species. We have to create a matrix that has the same order for the species.\n\n     c. We will get the list of species from the keys of the organisms dictionary (or we can get the unique species from the score keys? Actually, the score keys are in the form "sp1_sp2", so we don\'t have the list of all species. But we saved the scores in a nested structure? Actually, in the previous step we saved a flattened dictionary. How did we save? We had:\n\n        flat_scores = {}\n        for org1, inner_dict in scores_dict.items():\n            for org2, score in inner_dict.items():\n                key = f"{org1}_{org2}"\n                flat_scores[key] = score\n\n        But note: we only computed for i < j? Then we don\'t have the symmetric pairs? And we don\'t have the diagonal? So we have a triangular representation.\n\n     d. We have to create a list of unique species. We can extract them by splitting the keys? But note: we don\'t have self scores and we have each pair only once. Alternatively, we can read the original organisms.json to get the list of species.\n\n     e. We\'ll get the list of species (let\'s call it `species_list`). Then we create a distance matrix of size (n x n) where n = len(species_list). We can use:\n\n        distance_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j:\n                    distance_matrix[i, j] = 0   # but we don\'t use the diagonal in clustering? \n                else:\n                    # we have the key for (i,j) and (j,i) stored as either "sp1_sp2" or "sp2_sp1"\n                    # we stored only one direction? We stored for org1 and org2 with org1 < org2? Actually, in the previous code we did:\n\n                    # We computed only for i < j? Then in the flat_scores we have only one key per unordered pair? But the key is "org1_org2" and we don\'t have "org2_org1". So we have to be consistent.\n\n        We can do:\n            key1 = f"{species_list[i]}_{species_list[j]}"\n            key2 = f"{species_list[j]}_{species_list[i]}"\n            if key1 in flat_scores:\n                score = flat_scores[key1]\n            elif key2 in flat_scores:\n                score = flat_scores[key2]\n            else:\n                # This should not happen because we computed for every pair? \n                # Actually, we computed for every unordered pair? Then one of these should be present?\n                # But we stored only one: the one we created with the key in the order of the outer and inner loop? We did: for i, then for j where i<j? Then we have the key as "org1_org2" for the first one? And we have the same order as in the list? Not necessarily.\n\n        Alternatively, we can restructure: we have the flat_scores dictionary. We can create a mapping from (org1, org2) to score. Then we can do:\n\n            if (species_list[i], species_list[j]) in mapping or (species_list[j], species_list[i]) in mapping?\n\n        We can create a symmetric matrix? Since the score is symmetric? The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm we implemented is symmetric? Yes, because we check both orders for the substitution.\n\n     f. Actually, our nw_score function does not enforce symmetry? But the BLOSUM matrix is symmetric? Because the substitution of a to b is the same as b to a? In the BLOSUM file, we have both "ab" and "ba" with the same value? In the example: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3}. So our algorithm is symmetric? Then we can assume the score for (i,j) is the same as (j,i).\n\n     g. So we can do:\n\n            if i < j:\n                key = f"{species_list[i]}_{species_list[j]}"\n            else:\n                key = f"{species_list[j]}_{species_list[i]}"\n\n            if key in flat_scores:\n                score = flat_scores[key]\n            else:\n                # This should not happen because we computed for every pair? \n                # But what if we have only one species? Then we don\'t have any pairs? \n                # We should handle the case of one species separately.\n\n        Then set:\n            distance_matrix[i, j] = -score\n            distance_matrix[j, i] = -score   # symmetric\n\n     h. Then we can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with `method=\'single\'` and `metric=\'precomputed\'`? But note: the linkage function expects a condensed distance matrix? Or a square distance matrix? We can use the square form and then pass the square matrix? The linkage function can take a square matrix if we pass `metric=\'precomputed\'`? Actually, the documentation says: \n        "y : ndarray\n            A condensed distance matrix. A condensed distance matrix is a flat array containing the upper triangular of the distance matrix. This is the form that pdist returns. Alternatively, a collection of m observation vectors in n dimensions may be passed as an m by n array. All elements of the condensed distance matrix must be finite, i.e., no NaNs or infs."\n\n        But we have a square matrix. We can convert to condensed? Or we can use `squareform` to convert to condensed? Alternatively, we can use the `scipy.spatial.distance.squareform` to convert the square matrix to condensed? \n\n        Actually, the linkage function expects a condensed matrix (1d array of size n*(n-1)//2) for the upper triangular. We can compute that:\n\n            from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform\n            condensed = squareform(distance_matrix, force=\'tovector\')\n\n        But note: our distance_matrix has zeros on the diagonal? Then the condensed form will ignore the diagonal and the upper triangular (without diagonal) is taken? \n\n     i. Alternatively, we can build the condensed distance vector directly from the flat_scores without building the full matrix? We can list the species and then for i < j, we get the score and set the distance as -score. Then we have a vector of size n*(n-1)//2.\n\n 18. I choose to build the condensed vector:\n\n        n = len(species_list)\n        condensed_dists = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(i+1, n):\n                key = f"{species_list[i]}_{species_list[j]}"\n                if key not in flat_scores:\n                    # We should have computed every pair? \n                    raise ValueError(f"Missing score for pair {key}")\n                score = flat_scores[key]\n                condensed_dists.append(-score)   # because we want distance = -similarity\n\n 19. Then we pass `condensed_dists` to `linkage`.\n\n 20. After building the linkage, we get a matrix Z. Then we can build a tree from Z using `to_tree` method.\n\n 21. Then we traverse the tree and create a custom tree node structure that stores:\n        - the node id (we can assign arbitrary)\n        - the species name for leaves, or a label for internal nodes (like \'ancestor1\')\n        - the height (which is the original similarity, so we compute: similarity = - (distance stored in the node) ? But note: the linkage matrix stores the distance at which the merge happened. We want the node to store the similarity? So we set node.height = - (distance)\n\n 22. However, the `to_tree` function returns a node that has a `dist` attribute? Actually, the `to_tree` returns a `ClusterNode` which has:\n        - left: left child\n        - right: right child\n        - id: the node id (for leaves, id is the index in the original observations; for internal nodes, it is arbitrary and >= n)\n        - count: the number of leaves in the subtree\n        - and the distance (which is the distance stored in the linkage matrix) -> we want to convert that to similarity? But note: the height in the dendrogram is the distance? We want to store the similarity in our node? \n\n 23. We are going to create our own Node class for the tree? Because we want to store the height as the similarity? And we also want to be able to output Newick format? And we want to use it for the dendrogram? \n\n 24. Alternatively, we can use the `ClusterNode` but adjust the distance to be the similarity? But the `ClusterNode` uses the distance for the Newick format? We want the Newick to show the similarity? Then we must adjust.\n\n 25. Let\'s create a custom Node class:\n\n        class PhyloNode:\n            def __init__(self, id, name=None, height=0, left=None, right=None):\n                self.id = id\n                self.name = name   # for leaves, the species name; for internal nodes, we can leave as None or assign a label\n                self.height = height   # the similarity score at which this node was created (the merge)\n                self.left = left\n                self.right = right\n\n        Then we traverse the scipy tree and build our tree? But note: the `to_tree` returns a tree of `ClusterNode` objects. We can traverse it and convert each node to a `PhyloNode`.\n\n        How to assign the height? \n            For a leaf node: height = 0? Or we don\'t have a height for leaves? But in the dendrogram, leaves are at the bottom (height=0). Then the internal nodes are at the height of the similarity? \n\n        For an internal node: \n            original_distance = cluster_node.dist   [this is the distance at which the merge happened, which is -similarity]\n            then we set: height = - (cluster_node.dist)\n\n        But note: the root node: the root node\'s distance is the total distance from the last merge?

## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are building upon the previous steps. We have already computed the similarity scores and saved them in a JSON file. Now, we are to build a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) with single linkage, but note that we are using similarity scores (higher is better) rather than distances (lower is better). We\'ll convert similarity to distance appropriately.\n\n Steps for the tree building:\n 1. We have a set of species (leaves) and a similarity matrix (from Needleman-Wunsch). \n 2. Since hierarchical clustering typically uses distance, we can convert similarity to distance by:\n    - Option 1: distance = max_similarity - similarity, so that the most similar pair has the smallest distance.\n    - Option 2: distance = 1 / similarity (but this might lead to division by zero and doesn\'t preserve the scale).\n 3. However, note that the requirement says: we merge the most similar (highest score) first. So we want the two with the highest similarity to be clustered first. In distance terms, that would be the two with the smallest distance (if we define distance appropriately).\n\n But note: the tree node heights are to be the similarity score (so the higher the similarity, the lower the height in the tree if we think of time? Actually, in a dendrogram, the height usually represents the distance at which clusters are merged. However, the problem states: "During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it should have Needleman-Wunsch score assigned as its height". So we are using the similarity score as the height.\n\n Important: In the dendrogram, the height of a node will be the similarity score of the two merged clusters. Since we are using single linkage, the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any pair of elements in the two clusters.\n\n Steps for the algorithm:\n\n We\'ll use the following approach:\n\n  - Start with each organism as a cluster.\n  - We have a similarity matrix (for every pair of original organisms). For clusters, we will use the single linkage: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any element of cluster1 and any element of cluster2.\n  - However, note that we have only computed the scores for the original pairs. For clusters that are formed by multiple organisms, we will compute the similarity between two clusters as the maximum similarity between any two organisms, one from each cluster.\n\n  - We will maintain:\n        clusters: a list of current clusters (each cluster is a set of organisms, but we can also represent as a list of leaf names for now, and then we can build the tree structure)\n        a distance matrix? Actually, we have the full matrix for the original pairs. But as we merge, we need to compute the similarity between the new cluster and others.\n\n  - We need a data structure for the tree. We can create a tree node class that can represent the hierarchical structure.\n\n  - We are going to use the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for the clustering? But note: we are using similarity and we want to assign the height as the similarity. However, the linkage function in scipy expects distances. So we can convert our similarities to distances by: \n        distance = max_similarity - similarity   (to make sure distance is non-negative and higher similarity becomes lower distance)\n\n  - Steps with scipy:\n        1. Convert the similarity matrix to a distance matrix: D = max_sim - sim_matrix. But note: the similarity matrix is symmetric and we have the scores for every pair? We have computed for every pair in the first step, but stored in a nested dictionary? We need to convert to a condensed distance matrix (upper triangular) for scipy.\n\n  However, the problem says: "It is extremely important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wunsch scores." and also the node height must be the similarity score.\n\n  But note: the linkage function in scipy returns a linkage matrix that has the distance at which clusters are merged. We want the height to be the similarity, not the distance. So if we use D = max_sim - sim, then when we get a merge at distance d, the corresponding similarity would be max_sim - d. However, we can store the similarity as the height in our own tree structure.\n\n  Alternatively, we can build the tree ourselves without scipy? Given that the number of species might not be huge (but could be up to hundreds? thousands?), we can implement the hierarchical clustering ourselves. Since the problem requires the tree to be built with the similarity scores and we need to store the height (similarity) at each merge, it might be more transparent to build our own.\n\n  Let\'s design a TreeNode class to represent the tree:\n\n      class TreeNode:\n          def __init__(self, id, height=0, left=None, right=None):\n              self.id = id   # for leaves, this will be the organism name; for internal nodes, we can generate an id or just leave as None? But for Newick we need labels only for leaves? So we can leave internal nodes without id? Or we can assign a unique id for internal nodes? \n              self.height = height   # the similarity score at which this node is formed (for leaves, we can set height=0? or the similarity of the leaf with itself? But leaves are at the bottom. Actually, the leaves are the original sequences and they are at height 0? However, the problem says: the intermediate node for Horse and Dog has height 1200. So leaves are at height 0? But then the root would have the smallest similarity? Actually, no: we merge the most similar first (which has high similarity) and then less similar (lower similarity) later. So the root will have the lowest similarity? \n\n  However, note: the example says: "if species Horse and Dog have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200". So the height is the similarity score at which the merge happens.\n\n  In the dendrogram, the leaves are at the bottom (height=0) and then the merges happen at increasing heights? Actually, the height in the dendrogram is the similarity, so the leaves are at 0 and the merge events are at the similarity score. But the most similar merge (with the highest similarity) would be the one that happens at the highest value? and then we go downward? Actually, in a typical dendrogram, the leaves are at the bottom and the merges are drawn at a height that is the distance (so the higher the distance, the higher the merge bar). But we are using similarity: so the higher the similarity, the lower the bar? \n\n  But the problem says: "the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric" and "merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar)". So the first merge is at the highest similarity, and then the next at a lower similarity? \n\n  How to represent the tree:\n\n      Leaves: \n          height = 0? or the similarity of the leaf with itself? But we don\'t have that. We can set leaves to have height 0.\n\n      Internal nodes: \n          height = the similarity score at which the two clusters were merged.\n\n  Then, the distance from a leaf to an internal node would be the difference in heights? \n\n  However, the Newick format with distances requires branch lengths. The problem says: "second one should save both leaf nodes\' names and distances between branches in the tree". So we need to assign branch lengths.\n\n  How to assign branch lengths?\n\n      In a typical phylogenetic tree, the branch length from a node to its parent is the difference in height (or time) between the node and its parent.\n\n      For a leaf node (current height=0) and its parent at height h, the branch length would be h - 0 = h.\n\n      For an internal node that was formed at height h1 and then merged into a parent at height h2 (h2 < h1, because we are going upward in time? actually, we are merging from high similarity to low, so the parent merge happens at a lower similarity, meaning a later time? but the height is the similarity, so the parent node has a lower height). Then the branch length for that internal node to the parent would be h2 - h1? But wait: we are going from the leaf to the root, the heights are decreasing? \n\n  Alternatively, we can think of the height of a node as the time from the present (leaves) to the past. Then the root is the oldest. In that case, the branch length from a node to its parent would be the difference in time (parent\'s time - node\'s time). But in our case, the node\'s time is represented by the similarity? Actually, we are using the similarity as a proxy for time: higher similarity means closer in time.\n\n  How about we define the "time" as T = max_similarity - similarity? Then the higher the similarity, the lower the T (closer to present). Then the root would have T = max_similarity - min_similarity? \n\n  But the problem says: the intermediate node for Horse and Dog has a height of 1200. And we are to save the distances as integers without decimals.\n\n  For the Newick format with distances, we are to write the branch lengths. The problem does not specify how to compute the branch lengths. In a dendrogram built by hierarchical clustering, the branch length from a node to its parent is the difference in the distance (or similarity) at which the parent is formed and the node is formed.\n\n  However, note: in the example they just give an example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);". This example does not relate to our case. We must assign branch lengths appropriately.\n\n  Let me propose:\n\n      For a leaf node, we set its initial height to 0? But then the first merge happens at similarity S. Then the branch length from leaf A to the first internal node would be S - 0 = S? But wait, that would be the entire height. However, the two leaves (A and B) are merged at height S, so the branch from A to the internal node is S, and from B to the internal node is S? That would make the total distance from A to B 2*S? But in reality, the Needleman-Wunsch score is the alignment score, which is not a distance. \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the UPGMA method? But note: we are using single linkage.\n\n  After reading the problem again: "the tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species". And the intermediate node has a height of the similarity score.\n\n  How about we define the height of the root as 0? and then the leaves are at negative heights? That doesn\'t seem right.\n\n  Actually, in a typical hierarchical clustering dendrogram, the leaves are at 0 and the merges are drawn at the height of the distance (or similarity) at which they are merged. So the branch from the leaf to the merge point is the same for both? \n\n  For example, if we have two leaves A and B merged at similarity S, then in the dendrogram, there is a horizontal bar at height S, and two vertical lines from A and B up to that bar. The length of the vertical line for A is S - 0 = S, and for B is S - 0 = S.\n\n  But wait: the entire dendrogram is drawn such that the leaves are at the bottom (0) and the merge bar is at S. So the branch length from A to the internal node is S? \n\n  However, the problem says: "the distances between branches in the tree". In the example Newick string: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);", it assigns different branch lengths to A and B. But in our method, for the same merge, A and B would have the same branch length? \n\n  We are using single linkage, but the branch lengths for the two children of a node might be different? Actually, in a typical phylogenetic tree, the branch lengths can be different. However, in the UPGMA method (which assumes a molecular clock), the branch lengths from the internal node to the two children are set so that the children are equidistant to the internal node? But we are not using UPGMA, we are using single linkage.\n\n  How to assign branch lengths in a single linkage tree? \n\n  Actually, the standard way for single linkage (nearest neighbor) does not produce an additive tree. The dendrogram is drawn with the leaves at 0 and the merge at the distance (or similarity) for both children. So the branch length from the leaf to the merge node is the merge height (if we are using distance) or the maximum similarity minus the merge height (if we are using similarity as a distance)? \n\n  The problem states that the intermediate node has a height of the similarity score. So we can set:\n\n      For a leaf, we consider that it has been at height 0 until the merge. Then the branch length from the leaf to the internal node is (max_similarity - leaf_height) - (max_similarity - merge_similarity) = merge_similarity - leaf_height = merge_similarity.\n\n  But wait, that doesn\'t account for the fact that the leaf might be merged again later? \n\n  Alternatively, we can build the tree in a way that the branch length is the difference in height between the node and its parent? \n\n  Let me define:\n\n      Let H(n) be the height (similarity) of node n.\n\n      For a leaf, H(leaf) = 0? But then when we merge two leaves at height h, the internal node has height h. Then the branch length for each leaf to the internal node is h - 0 = h.\n\n      Then if we merge two clusters that have internal nodes, say cluster1 (with root node n1 at height h1) and cluster2 (with root node n2 at height h2) at height h (which is the maximum similarity between any two points in the two clusters, and h < min(h1, h2)? because we are merging from high to low similarity). Then the new internal node has height h. The branch length for n1 to the new node would be h1 - h, and for n2 would be h2 - h.\n\n  This is the method used in UPGMA? But note: we are using single linkage. The difference is in how we compute the similarity between clusters, but once we have the merge height, we can assign the branch lengths by the drop in height.\n\n  This method will produce an ultrametric tree (all leaves at the same distance from the root). \n\n  Steps for building the tree:\n\n      We\'ll create a TreeNode class that can have children and a height.\n\n      We\'ll maintain a list of current clusters (each cluster is represented by its root TreeNode).\n\n      We also need a function to compute the similarity between two clusters: for single linkage, it\'s the maximum similarity between any two organisms in the two clusters.\n\n      We have the precomputed similarity for every pair of original organisms. For clusters, we can compute the similarity by:\n          sim(cluster1, cluster2) = max{ sim(x,y) for x in cluster1, y in cluster2 }\n\n      However, we cannot precompute all because the number of clusters changes. We can maintain a distance matrix (or similarity matrix) between clusters? But the number of clusters is decreasing.\n\n      We can use a priority queue to get the next merge: the pair of clusters with the highest similarity.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          Initialize:\n            clusters = [ TreeNode(organism, height=0) for each organism ]\n            We also have a similarity matrix for the original pairs (stored in a dictionary of dictionaries, or we can use a 2D array? but we have the species names). Let\'s keep a dictionary: sim_matrix[org1][org2] = score.\n\n            We also maintain a global lookup for the cluster that contains each original organism? Actually, each leaf is fixed.\n\n          Then, we need to compute the similarity between every pair of clusters. We can store a nested dictionary: cluster_sim[i][j] = similarity between cluster i and j.\n\n          But we start with n clusters. We can use a matrix of size n x n? Then update it as we merge.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a priority queue that has all the pairs of clusters with their similarity. But when we merge, we remove the two clusters and add a new one, and then compute the similarity of the new cluster to every other cluster.\n\n          How to compute the similarity between the new cluster and another cluster? \n              sim(new_cluster, other) = max( sim(old_cluster1, other), sim(old_cluster2, other) )   [for single linkage]\n\n          We can do:\n\n            clusters = list of current clusters (each cluster is a set of original organism names? and also we have a representative TreeNode for the cluster)\n\n            We maintain a similarity matrix between clusters: we can use a dictionary keyed by the cluster id (or the tuple of the set of organisms) but that becomes heavy. Alternatively, we can use an index for each cluster.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the number of species might be moderate (say, up to a few hundred), we can do:\n\n            current_sim: a matrix (as a list of lists) for the current clusters. The dimension is the current number of clusters.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Initialize:\n              clusters = list of leaf nodes (each is a singleton)\n              current_sim = a matrix of size n x n, where n = len(clusters). For i and j, current_sim[i][j] = sim(organisms_i, organisms_j) (if i != j). We know this from the precomputed scores.\n\n            Then, while there is more than one cluster:\n\n              Find the pair (i, j) with the maximum current_sim[i][j] (and i < j)\n\n              Create a new node:\n                  new_node = TreeNode(id = None, height = current_sim[i][j])\n                  new_node.left = clusters[i]\n                  new_node.right = clusters[j]\n\n              Remove clusters i and j, and add new_node.\n\n              Update the similarity matrix: remove rows and columns i and j, and add a new row and column for the new cluster.\n\n              How to compute the similarity between the new cluster and an existing cluster k?\n                  sim(new, k) = max( sim(old_i, k), sim(old_j, k) )\n\n          We need to keep track of the index of each cluster.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      We\'ll maintain:\n        clusters: a list of TreeNodes (the current clusters)\n        sim_matrix: a 2D list (or numpy array) of size len(clusters) x len(clusters)\n\n      But note: the sim_matrix is symmetric and we don\'t need the diagonal.\n\n      Steps for updating the matrix:\n\n        Let the indices of the two clusters to be merged be i and j (i < j).

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to use the `Bio.Phylo` module from Biopython for tree handling and Newick export, and `matplotlib` for plotting the dendrogram.\n However, note that Biopython\'s `Phylo` module expects a tree in the form of `Bio.Phylo.Newick.Tree` or `Bio.Phylo.BaseTree.Tree`. We are building the tree via hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) using the similarity scores.\n\n Steps for the second task (building the tree):\n 1. We have a matrix of similarity scores (from the first task) for every pair of organisms. But note: our matrix is stored in a nested dictionary (from the first task) and we have saved a flattened version to a JSON file. We can either recompute or read from the saved JSON.\n\n 2. Since the clustering algorithm in `scipy` works on distance, not similarity, we must convert our similarity to distance. We can do:\n        distance = max_similarity - similarity\n    where max_similarity is the maximum score in the matrix. This will make the most similar pair have the smallest distance.\n\n 3. We can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for the clustering. The linkage function requires a condensed distance matrix (upper triangle as a flat vector). We will create a list of organisms (to remember the order) and then build the condensed distance matrix.\n\n 4. After building the linkage matrix, we can use `to_tree` method of the linkage matrix to get a tree in the form of a `ClusterNode` which we can then convert to a Biopython tree.\n\n 5. However, note: the requirement is to have the height of each internal node as the Needleman-Wunsch score (similarity) at which the merge happened. But the linkage algorithm uses distances. So we have to adjust: \n        height = max_similarity - distance_at_merge\n    because the distance_at_merge is the distance between the two clusters being merged (which in our case is max_similarity - similarity_at_merge).\n\n 6. Alternatively, we can avoid the conversion by using the similarity directly? But the linkage algorithm is designed for distances. So we stick to conversion.\n\n 7. We\'ll build a tree structure that can be used by Biopython for Newick export and dendrogram plotting.\n\n 8. For the dendrogram, we can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram` and then customize the plot to use the similarity on the x-axis? The instruction says: "x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". Actually, in a dendrogram, the horizontal axis is usually the labels (organisms) and the vertical axis is the distance (or similarity). But the instruction says "horizontally", meaning we want a horizontal dendrogram. And the x-axis should be the Needleman-Wunsch score? \n\n    Clarification: Typically, in a horizontal dendrogram, the leaves are on the left and the branches extend to the right. The horizontal position of the branch is determined by the similarity (or distance). But note: the instruction says "x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". This is ambiguous. However, in the context, the "height" of a node (which in the tree is the similarity score) should be represented along the axis of the branch lengths. \n\n    We have two options for the dendrogram:\n        Option A: Use the distance (converted from similarity) for the branch lengths. Then the horizontal axis (if we plot horizontally) would be the distance. But we want the similarity to be represented? \n        Option B: We can use the similarity as the branch length? But note: the internal node\'s height is the similarity at which they were merged. So if we use the similarity as the branch length, then the total distance from the root to a leaf would be the sum of the branch lengths? That doesn\'t make sense in the context of a dendrogram built from similarity.\n\n    Actually, in a typical hierarchical clustering dendrogram, the vertical (or horizontal) position of the node is the distance (or similarity) at which the merge happened. So we can plot the dendrogram with the similarity on the horizontal axis (for a horizontal dendrogram) and the leaves on the vertical axis.\n\n    How to do it: \n        We will use the `dendrogram` function with `orientation=\'left\'` to make it horizontal. Then we set the `xlabel` to be the similarity score.\n\n    But note: the linkage algorithm uses distances. We converted our similarity to distance. The dendrogram function will use the distance (which is max_similarity - similarity) for the positions. So the horizontal axis will show the distance. We want to show the similarity? We can relabel the axis.\n\n    Alternatively, we can flip the axis: set the horizontal axis to be from max_similarity to min_similarity? But that might be confusing.\n\n    Let me re-read: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". The raw Needleman-Wunsch scores are the similarities. So we want the horizontal axis to be the similarity. We can set the dendrogram to use the distance (which is max_sim - sim) and then relabel the ticks to show the corresponding similarity? \n\n    Example: if max_sim=1000, and at a node the distance (from the dendrogram) is 200, then the similarity at that node is 800. We can change the tick labels: \n        Instead of showing 0, 200, 400, ... we show 1000, 800, 600, ...\n\n    But note: the instruction says "raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" - but they are actually scores (similarities). The term "distances" might be a misnomer. We\'ll assume they mean the similarity scores.\n\n    We can do:\n        max_sim = max(similarity_matrix.values()) # actually, we have a symmetric matrix, so we can take the max of the flattened values?\n        Then, we compute the distance matrix: D[i,j] = max_sim - similarity(i,j)\n\n    Then, when plotting, we can set:\n        plt.gca().set_xticks(ticks)\n        plt.gca().set_xticklabels(max_sim - ticks)\n\n    Alternatively, we can avoid the conversion in the plot by using the similarity directly as the "distance" in the dendrogram? But the linkage algorithm requires increasing distances. We can use:\n        distance = max_sim - similarity\n    and then when we build the dendrogram, we can set `labels` to the organism names and then change the x-axis labels to show the similarity.\n\n    We\'ll do the conversion for the axis labels.\n\n 9. Steps for the code:\n\n    a. Read the saved scores from "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json". We need to reconstruct a matrix (or condensed vector) for the clustering.\n\n    b. Create a list of organism names (the same order as in the matrix).\n\n    c. Build a condensed distance matrix (1D array of the upper triangle) for the linkage function.\n\n    d. Perform hierarchical clustering with `method=\'single\'` (single linkage) and `metric=\'precomputed\'`.\n\n    e. Convert the linkage matrix to a tree structure (using `to_tree` from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`).\n\n    f. Convert the `ClusterNode` tree to a Biopython tree for Newick export.\n\n    g. For the dendrogram, plot using `dendrogram` with `orientation=\'left\'` and adjust the x-axis to show similarity.\n\n    h. Save the dendrogram as a PNG file.\n\n 10. However, note: the requirement for the internal node\'s height is the similarity score. In the linkage matrix, the distance (which is max_sim - similarity) is stored. So when we build the tree, we can set the branch lengths as the difference in the similarity? But the Newick format with distances requires branch lengths. We are going to define:\n\n        For a leaf node: the branch length from its parent to itself is (parent.height - leaf.height) but note: leaves are at height 0? Not exactly.\n\n    Actually, in our construction, each leaf is at height 0? Then the branch length for a leaf would be the height of its parent (which is the similarity at which it was merged) minus 0? But that branch length would be the similarity of the merge. However, that leaf might be merged multiple times? \n\n    We need to think: the tree we are building is a dendrogram where the height of a node is the similarity at which it was created. The branch length from a node to its child is the difference in the heights (if we are building an ultrametric tree). \n\n    How we build the tree:\n\n        We start with each leaf at height 0.\n\n        When we merge two clusters, the new node is created at height = similarity score of that merge.\n\n        Then, the branch length from the new node to each child is: (new node\'s height) - (child\'s current height).\n\n        This way, the root will have the height of the last merge, and the branch lengths will be the increments.\n\n    We can do this during the tree building.\n\n    But note: the `scipy` linkage tree (ClusterNode) does not store the branch lengths in this way. It stores the distance (which is max_sim - similarity) as the node\'s distance. We have to convert back to similarity.\n\n    Actually, we can build a custom tree structure for Biopython that uses the similarity.\n\n    Alternatively, we can use the `ClusterNode` and then traverse it to set the branch lengths as:\n\n        branch_length = (max_sim - node.dist) - (max_sim - child.dist)   [if we stored the distance in the node]\n\n    But that becomes complicated.\n\n    Instead, let\'s build the tree for Biopython from the linkage matrix by traversing and setting the branch lengths as the difference in the similarity (which we can compute as: \n        branch_length = (max_sim - node.dist) - (max_sim - child.dist) = child.dist - node.dist   [but this is negative?]\n\n    This is messy.\n\n    I propose:\n\n        We are going to store the tree as a Biopython tree. We can create `Bio.Phylo.BaseTree.Tree` or `Bio.Phylo.Newick.Tree` by traversing the `ClusterNode` from `scipy` and setting:\n\n            For a leaf node: \n                name = organism name\n                branch_length = (max_sim - leaf.dist) ??? \n\n        Actually, the `ClusterNode` in scipy doesn\'t store branch lengths. The linkage matrix represents the nodes by their distance (which is our max_sim - similarity). The `to_tree` method returns a tree of `ClusterNode` objects with:\n\n            left: left child\n            right: right child\n            id: node id (negative for internal, non-negative for leaves)\n            dist: the distance (from the linkage) of this node? Actually, the linkage matrix has the distance at which the node was formed.\n\n        We want the branch length from a node to its parent? But we are building from the root.\n\n        We can define:\n\n            root = tree from scipy\n\n            We traverse the tree and set for each child of a node:\n\n                child.branch_length = (max_sim - child.dist) - (max_sim - parent.dist) \n                                    = parent.dist - child.dist\n\n            However, note: the root has no parent. The root\'s distance is the maximum distance (lowest similarity) and the leaves have distance 0? Actually, in the linkage tree, the leaves are at distance 0? \n\n        How the linkage tree is built: the leaves are created with distance 0. Then the first merge happens at distance d1, then the next at d2, etc. The root will have the largest distance.\n\n        Then the branch length for a leaf to its parent is: parent.dist (because leaf.dist=0).\n\n        For an internal node (non-root) to its parent: parent.dist - node.dist.\n\n        For the root, we don\'t set a branch length? But in Newick, the root has no branch length.\n\n        However, note: in the example Newick string with distances: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);", the root has a branch length of 5? Actually, the root is the node that has children A, B, and a subtree (C,D). The branch length for the root is 5? \n\n        But in our case, the root branch length doesn\'t have a meaning? We can set it to 0.\n\n    So plan for the tree:\n\n        We\'ll traverse the scipy ClusterNode tree and build a Biopython tree. We set:\n\n            For a leaf node (ClusterNode.id >= 0):\n                Create a Clade(name=organism_names[id], branch_length = parent.dist - node.dist) but wait, node.dist for a leaf is 0? \n\n            Actually, in the ClusterNode returned by `to_tree`, the leaves have `dist=0` and the internal nodes have `dist` set to the distance at which they were formed.\n\n        Then, for a leaf, the branch length from the parent to this leaf is: (parent\'s distance) - (leaf\'s distance) = parent.dist - 0.\n\n        For an internal node that is not the root: the branch length from the parent to this node is: parent.dist - node.dist.\n\n        For the root: we set branch_length=0.\n\n    But note: the distance we are using is the converted distance (max_sim - similarity). So the branch lengths we are computing are in the distance space. We want to output in the similarity space? \n\n    Actually, the instruction for the Newick format says: the distances (branch lengths) should be integers without decimal points. And they should be the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores? \n\n    But wait: the branch length in the Newick format is the length of the branch, not the height of the node. We defined the height of the node as the similarity. The branch length is the difference between the parent\'s similarity and the child\'s similarity? \n\n    Example:\n\n        We have two leaves A and B with similarity s. They are merged at a node N with height s. The branch from N to A: the height of N is s, and A is at 0? Then the branch length is s? \n\n        Similarly, if we have an internal node M (parent of N and another leaf C) that was formed at similarity t (t < s), then the branch from M to N is s - t.\n\n    So the branch lengths are the differences in the similarity scores.\n\n    How do we get that?\n\n        We have stored the node\'s distance (in the scipy tree) as d = max_sim - s, where s is the similarity.\n\n        Then, the branch length for a leaf A (under node N) is: s (the similarity at N) - 0 = s.\n\n        But in the distance space, the branch length would be: (max_sim - 0) - (max_sim - s) = s.\n\n        And for the branch from M to N: \n            In similarity space: s - t.\n            In distance space: (max_sim - t) - (max_sim - s) = s - t.\n\n        So the branch length in distance space is the same as in similarity space? \n\n        Actually, note: the branch length is the difference in the similarity? But we are storing the node\'s height as the similarity. The branch length is the difference between the parent\'s height and the child\'s height? \n\n        However, in our tree, the child\'s height is the similarity at which it was created (for an internal node) or 0 for a leaf. The parent\'s height is the similarity at which it was created.\n\n        Therefore, the branch length is: parent.height - child.height.\n\n        But note: the root has no parent? We set its branch length to 0.\n\n        And the leaf\'s branch length: parent.height - 0 = parent.height.\n\n        But wait: that would mean the leaf\'s branch length is the similarity of the parent? \n\n        However, the leaf hasn\'t been created at any merge? The leaf is at the bottom. Its "height" is 0. The parent (the first merge) is at height s. So the branch from the parent to the leaf is s - 0 = s.\n\n        This matches.\n\n    Therefore, the branch length in the Newick tree should be computed as the difference in the node\'s similarity (which we can get from the distance in the scipy tree by: similarity = max_sim - node.dist) but note: the branch length is the difference in the similarities, which is the same as the difference in the distances? \n\n        Let parent_sim = max_sim - parent_dist\n        child_sim = max_sim - child_dist\n        branch_length = parent_sim - child_sim = (max_sim - parent_dist) - (max_sim - child_dist) = child_dist - parent_dist\n\n    But that is negative? \n\n    Actually, the parent_dist is greater than the child_dist (because the parent was merged later, at a lower similarity, so higher distance). Therefore, we want the branch length to be positive? \n\n    We defined: branch_length = parent_sim - child_sim.\n\n    Since parent_sim < child_sim (because the parent is a later merge at a lower similarity), we get a negative number.\n\n    This is a problem.\n\n    We need to reconsider: \n\n        We want the branch length to represent the amount of evolution? In a dendrogram built from similarity, the branch from a parent to a child should be the amount of similarity that was lost? \n\n        Alternatively, we can define the branch length as the time? But we don\'t have time.\n\n        The instruction for the Newick format example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" has positive numbers.\n\n        How about we define the branch length as the difference in the distance space? \n\n            branch_length = parent_dist - child_dist\n\n        Then, for a leaf: \n            parent_dist - child_dist = parent_dist - 0 = parent_dist = max_sim - parent_sim.\n\n        But parent_sim is the similarity of the merge. We don\'t want the branch length to be max_sim - parent_sim.\n\n    After re-thinking: the standard way in a dendrogram is to have the branch length represent the amount of change (which is the distance). So if we are using the distance (max_sim - similarity) as the metric, then the branch length should be the difference in the distance? \n\n        For a leaf: the branch length is the distance at the parent (which is max_sim - parent_sim).\n\n        For an internal node: the branch length to its parent is parent_dist - node_dist.\n\n        Then, in the Newick format, we output these branch lengths (which are in the distance space) and they are positive.\n\n        And when we'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3852, 'total_tokens': 7948, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 3648}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 3648, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 204}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'f9521ce9-b017-4373-9dbb-ff6d58ad8caa', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--52884a0a-44a9-4cda-87b6-2feec7a050fa-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3852, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 7948, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 3648}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to implement the following steps for the third task:\n\n 1. Read the thresholds from the file "thresholds.txt". Each line contains one integer threshold.\n 2. For each threshold, traverse the phylogenetic tree (which we built in the second task) to determine clusters of species.\n    - The tree is built with internal nodes having a "height" (which is the Needleman-Wunsch score at which the merge happened).\n    - We note that two leaves are in the same cluster if the path from one to the other does not go below the threshold (i.e., the highest node (lowest in the tree) that is common to both has a height >= threshold).\n    - However, a simpler way is to use the concept of cutting the dendrogram at the threshold. We traverse the tree and whenever we encounter a node with height below the threshold, we do not merge its children and instead treat the subtrees as separate clusters.\n\n 3. The clusters should be represented as a list of sets (or list of lists) of species names (the leaf names).\n\n 4. We will save the clusters for each threshold in a structured way. Since the thresholds file may have multiple thresholds, we can output a JSON file that maps each threshold to the list of clusters (each cluster being a list of species).\n\n 5. The output file should be named "clusters_blosumXX.json" (where XX is the BLOSUM version) and have a structure like:\n    {\n        "threshold1": [["species1", "species2"], ["species3"]],\n        "threshold2": [ ... ],\n        ...\n    }\n\n However, note: the threshold values are integers and we will use them as keys in the JSON. But JSON keys must be strings, so we can convert the threshold to string.\n\n Alternatively, we can have an array of objects, but the requirement is to map thresholds to clusters.\n\n Implementation:\n\n We assume that we have built a tree in the previous step (using hierarchical clustering) and we have a tree structure (like the one from scipy.cluster.hierarchy or our own). Since we built the tree with the `HierarchicalClustering` class (which we created for the second task), we can add a method to that class to extract clusters at a given threshold.\n\n Steps for the method:\n\n   def get_clusters(self, threshold):\n        # We start from the root and traverse down until the node height is above the threshold.\n        # When we hit a node that has height <= threshold, we do not merge its children and instead collect the leaves from each child as separate clusters.\n        # But note: our tree is built by merging, and the height of a node is the similarity score at which the merge happened. We are merging from high similarity (which we consider as high in the tree) to low. However, in the dendrogram, the root is at the top (with the highest similarity value) and the leaves are at the bottom (with 0).\n\n        Actually, our tree is built so that the root has the highest similarity (the last merge) and the leaves have 0. So when we cut at a threshold (say T), we want to break the tree at any node that has a height <= T? But note: we merged when the similarity was high. The threshold is a similarity score: we want to consider that two species are in the same cluster if they were merged at a similarity above the threshold. So we break the tree at nodes that have height < threshold? Actually, we break at the point where the node\'s height is below the threshold? \n\n        However, note: the threshold is a similarity score. We want to group species that have a similarity of at least the threshold. So we break the tree at the node where the similarity (height) is less than the threshold. Therefore, we traverse the tree and whenever a node has a height >= threshold, we consider that the two children are still merged (so they are in the same cluster). When we find a node with height < threshold, we do not merge the two branches and instead they form separate clusters.\n\n        But note: the entire tree is built with the root having the highest similarity. So we can do:\n\n        clusters = []\n        stack = [self.root]\n        while stack:\n            node = stack.pop()\n            if node.height >= threshold:\n                # This node is above the threshold, so we merge the clusters from its children.\n                # But we cannot merge until we break at the threshold. Actually, we need to traverse until we find the nodes that are below the threshold and then collect the leaves.\n                # Alternatively, we can do a recursive traversal: if the node is a leaf, then we return a cluster with just that leaf.\n                # If the node is internal and its height >= threshold, then we merge the clusters from the left and right.\n                # If the node is internal and its height < threshold, then we return the clusters from left and right as separate.\n\n        However, note: we built the tree so that every internal node has a height (the similarity at which the merge happened). We want to break at the point where the node\'s height is below the threshold, meaning that the merge happened at a similarity lower than the threshold, so we don\'t merge.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n        def _get_clusters(node, threshold):\n            if node is None:\n                return []\n            if node.is_leaf():\n                return [ {node.name} ]   # a set containing the leaf name\n\n            left_clusters = _get_clusters(node.left, threshold)\n            right_clusters = _get_clusters(node.right, threshold)\n\n            if node.height >= threshold:\n                # Merge all the clusters from left and right into one cluster\n                merged = set()\n                for cluster in left_clusters:\n                    merged |= cluster\n                for cluster in right_clusters:\n                    merged |= cluster\n                return [merged]\n            else:\n                # We don\'t merge at this node, so we return the clusters from left and right as separate\n                return left_clusters + right_clusters\n\n        But note: this will merge all the clusters below the node if the node is above the threshold. However, we might have multiple clusters in the left or right? Actually, the recursive call returns a list of clusters (sets) for the subtree. If the node is above the threshold, we merge all the clusters from the left and right into one. But if the node is below, we return the clusters from left and right without merging.\n\n        However, consider: the entire subtree of the left might have multiple clusters? Actually, if the left child is an internal node that is below the threshold, then the left subtree would already have been broken into clusters. So the recursive call returns the clusters from the left and right.\n\n        But note: what if the left child is an internal node that is above the threshold? Then the recursive call for the left would return one merged cluster for the entire left subtree? \n\n        Example:\n\n        Root (height=1000)\n          |-> Left: Node A (height=900) with two leaves: [A1, A2]\n          |-> Right: Node B (height=800) with two leaves: [B1, B2]\n\n        If threshold=850, then at the root (1000>=850) -> we would merge the clusters from left and right. But the left node (900>=850) so the left returns one cluster {A1, A2}. The right node (800<850) so the right returns two clusters: {B1}, {B2}. Then we merge: {A1, A2, B1, B2}? \n\n        But wait, the root is above the threshold, so we merge the entire left and right. However, the right subtree is broken at the node of height=800 (which is below 850) so we have two clusters in the right. But then we merge them at the root? That would be incorrect because the root is above the threshold.\n\n        Actually, the entire right subtree is merged at the root? But the root is above the threshold, so we are allowed to merge the entire right subtree? \n\n        The idea: the threshold says that we consider two species to be in the same cluster if the similarity at which they merged is at least the threshold. The root has a similarity of 1000, which is above 850, so all species under the root are in the same cluster? \n\n        However, that would ignore the structure below. Actually, the root is the last merge, so it represents the entire set. But we have a merge in the right subtree at 800, which is below 850. So the species B1 and B2 are merged at 800, which is below 850, meaning they are not similar enough? Then they should be in separate clusters? But the root merge at 1000 is above 850, so we merge the entire set. \n\n        This leads to a contradiction: we are forced to merge B1 and B2 because the root is above the threshold, even though they are not similar enough? \n\n        We must reconsider: the tree is built by merging the most similar pairs first. The root is the last merge and has the smallest similarity (if we are doing single linkage, the root might be the merge of two clusters that are connected by a low similarity). Actually, in our case, the root has the highest similarity value? No, wait: we merged starting from the highest similarity. The root is the last merge and therefore has the lowest similarity? \n\n        Actually, the root should have the lowest similarity because we merge the closest first and then the more distant. So the root height is the smallest value? \n\n        But in our tree building step, we set the height of the new node to the similarity score (which is high for similar sequences). So the root will have the highest similarity? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n\n        We start with each species as a leaf. Then we find the pair with the highest similarity (say 1200) and merge them. Then we form a new node with height=1200. Then we continue. The next highest might be 1100, then 1000, and so on. The root will be the last merge and will have the lowest similarity? \n\n        Actually, no: the root will have the similarity of the last merge, which is the lowest similarity among all the merges? \n\n        But wait: we are merging the two clusters that have the highest similarity at each step. So the first merge has the highest similarity, and the last merge (the root) has the lowest similarity. \n\n        Therefore, the root has the smallest similarity value? \n\n        Then in the dendrogram, the root is at the bottom (with the smallest value) and the leaves are at the top? \n\n        However, in our previous description, we said the root is the origin of life and the leaves are the current species. So the root is at the top? \n\n        Actually, in a dendrogram, the root is at the top (with the smallest similarity) and the leaves are at the bottom? \n\n        But we have a requirement: the dendrogram should be drawn horizontally and the x-axis by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. So we are using the similarity as the x-axis? \n\n        This is confusing. Let me re-read the second task instruction:\n\n        "During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it should have Needleman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200"\n\n        And then: "the tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species."\n\n        So the root is the last merge and has the smallest similarity? \n\n        But note: the example: Horse and Dog merged at 1200. Then later, we might merge (Horse, Dog) with Cat at 1000. Then the root would have 1000? \n\n        So the root has the smallest similarity? \n\n        Now, for the threshold: we want to cut the tree at a threshold. We break the tree at nodes that have similarity (height) below the threshold? Because if the similarity at which two clusters are merged is below the threshold, we do not merge them? \n\n        Therefore, the algorithm for cluster extraction:\n\n        We traverse the tree (post-order) and at each node:\n\n          if the node is a leaf: return a cluster containing just that leaf.\n\n          else:\n            left_clusters = clusters from left subtree\n            right_clusters = clusters from right subtree\n\n            if node.height >= threshold: \n                then we merge all clusters from left and right into one cluster? But wait, the left_clusters might be multiple clusters? Actually, the recursive call returns a list of clusters (each cluster is a set of leaves) for the subtree. If the node is above the threshold, we merge all the clusters from left and right? \n\n            However, that would merge everything below the node. But what if the left subtree has multiple clusters? Then we are merging them all? \n\n        Actually, the recursive call breaks the subtree at the threshold, so the left_clusters might be multiple clusters (if there are nodes in the left subtree that are below the threshold). But then we are merging them at the current node? \n\n        Example:\n\n        Root (height=1000)\n          left: Node A (height=900) -> returns one cluster {A1, A2} (because 900>=threshold, say 850, so merged)\n          right: Node B (height=800) -> returns two clusters: {B1}, {B2} (because 800<850, so not merged)\n\n        Then at the root (1000>=850) we merge: so we combine {A1, A2} and {B1} and {B2} into one cluster? \n\n        But that would be one cluster: {A1, A2, B1, B2}. This is correct because the root is above the threshold, so we merge the entire set.\n\n        Now, if the threshold is 950, then:\n\n          Root (1000>=950) -> we would merge the left and right.\n          Left: Node A (900<950) -> so returns two clusters: {A1}, {A2}\n          Right: Node B (800<950) -> returns two clusters: {B1}, {B2}\n          Then we merge: so one cluster {A1, A2, B1, B2}? \n\n        But is that correct? The root is above the threshold, so we merge the entire set? \n\n        However, the two leaves A1 and A2 were merged at 900, which is below 950, so they should not be merged? But the root merge at 1000 (which is above 950) forces them to be merged? \n\n        This is the nature of the tree: the root merge is the last merge and it merges the entire set. So even if two leaves are not directly merged above the threshold, they are connected through the root? \n\n        Actually, in single linkage, the entire set is connected if the root is above the threshold? \n\n        But that might not be what we want. We want to form clusters such that within a cluster, every pair of species has a similarity at least the threshold? \n\n        But note: the tree is built with single linkage. The similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any pair of elements (one from each cluster). So if the root is above the threshold, then there exists a path of connections (each connection with similarity>=threshold) between any two leaves? \n\n        Actually, no. The root merge at 1000 means that the two clusters (which are the entire left and right) have at least one pair of elements (one from left and one from right) that have similarity 1000. But the left cluster might have two leaves that are only connected by a chain: A1 and A2 were merged at 900 (which is below 950) so they are not directly connected above 950, but they are connected through the root? \n\n        However, in the tree, the path from A1 to A2 goes through the node at 900 (which is below 950) and then to the root at 1000? \n\n        The condition for being in the same cluster is that the entire path between two leaves has all the merge points above the threshold? \n\n        Actually, no: the condition is that the two leaves are in the same cluster if the highest merge point (i.e., the node that is the lowest common ancestor) has a height >= threshold. \n\n        In our example for A1 and A2: the lowest common ancestor is the node A (height=900). Since 900 < 950, they are not in the same cluster? \n\n        But then why did we merge them at the root? \n\n        This indicates that our recursive method is flawed.\n\n        We need to reconsider: the tree is built with the property that the similarity of the lowest common ancestor of two leaves is the similarity at which they were first merged into the same cluster. In single linkage, that is the maximum similarity along the path? Actually, no: it is the similarity at which the two clusters containing these two leaves were merged. And in single linkage, that is the maximum similarity between any two points in the two clusters? \n\n        However, for two leaves, the similarity at which they are merged is the similarity between them. But when we build the tree, we might merge A1 and A2 at 900, and then merge the cluster (A1,A2) with A3 at 850. Then the lowest common ancestor of A1 and A3 is the root (850). \n\n        So the condition for two leaves to be in the same cluster at threshold T is that the similarity at their lowest common ancestor is >= T? \n\n        Actually, no: because the root has 850, which is below 900? \n\n        But then if the threshold is 860, then A1 and A3 would be in the same cluster? \n\n        Actually, they should be: because the chain A1--A2--A3 has a link (A1-A2) at 900 and A2-A3 at 850? But the similarity between A1 and A3 is not directly 850, but the single linkage would take the maximum along the path? \n\n        However, the tree building with single linkage does not guarantee that the lowest common ancestor represents the similarity between the two leaves. It represents the similarity at which the two clusters were merged. \n\n        For two leaves, the similarity is the direct one. For three leaves, the root represents the similarity at which the last two clusters were merged. \n\n        So for A1 and A3, the similarity in the tree is 850? \n\n        Therefore, if we set the threshold to 860, then A1 and A3 would not be in the same cluster? \n\n        This suggests that we should not break the tree by the node\'s own height, but by the entire path. \n\n        Actually, the standard way to extract clusters from a dendrogram is to cut the tree at the threshold and then take the connected components at that threshold. \n\n        How to do it?\n\n        We can use the following: \n\n          - Represent the set of leaves and connect two leaves if the similarity between them is >= threshold? But that would be O(n^2) and we already have the tree.\n\n        Alternatively, we can traverse the tree and break at every'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4051, 'total_tokens': 8147, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 3840}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 3840, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 211}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '411f0028-c48d-407a-aa67-78996508689f', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--2fabaebf-5305-40e4-9b45-ab563cba4b15-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4051, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8147, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 3840}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to break down the project into several files and modules for clarity and maintainability.\n\nThe main steps are:\n1. Read the organisms and BLOSUM matrix.\n2. Compute the Needleman-Wunsch scores for all pairs and save to a JSON file.\n3. Build a phylogenetic tree (using hierarchical clustering with single linkage, but note: we are using similarity, so we need to convert to distance appropriately? However, the instruction says to use the raw scores and merge the most similar (highest score) first. So we can use the similarity matrix and use a method that merges the highest similarity. But note: most hierarchical clustering algorithms work on distance (dissimilarity). So we can convert the similarity to distance by: distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or use negative similarity? However, the instruction says to use the raw scores and that the tree node heights are the Needleman-Wunsch scores.\n\nApproach for tree building:\n- We are going to use an agglomerative clustering (bottom-up) with the following:\n  - Start with each organism as a cluster.\n  - At each step, find the two clusters (i and j) with the highest similarity (i.e., the highest Needleman-Wunsch score between any two organisms in the two clusters? But note: we are using single linkage. However, the problem says "single linkage methodology", but then we are merging the two most similar clusters. In single linkage, the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any member of one cluster and any member of the other.\n\nBut note: we have only computed the scores for the original organisms. We do not have scores for clusters (which are hypothetical ancestors). Therefore, we must use the precomputed pairwise scores for the leaves. However, when we form a new cluster, we need to compute the similarity between the new cluster and other clusters? For single linkage, the similarity between cluster A and cluster B is the maximum similarity between any organism in A and any organism in B.\n\nBut note: we have stored the pairwise scores for the original organisms. We can use that to compute the similarity between clusters by taking the maximum (because we are using single linkage and we are working with similarity) for any pair of organisms in the two clusters.\n\nHowever, the problem says: "the tree should be created with a single-linkage clustering method, using Needleman-Wunsch scores as similarity metric". So we will use the single linkage (i.e., the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two elements in the two clusters).\n\nBut note: we have a complete matrix for the leaves. We can use that to drive the clustering.\n\nSteps for clustering:\n1. Start with each organism as a cluster.\n2. The height (or the similarity at which they merge) is the similarity score of the two organisms that are being merged. But when we merge two clusters, the similarity for the merge is the maximum similarity between any two organisms in the two clusters (which we already have in our precomputed matrix?).\n\nHowever, we must note: the precomputed matrix is only for the original organisms. We do not have sequences for the clusters to recompute. Therefore, we must use the precomputed pairwise scores and update the similarity matrix for clusters by taking the maximum (for single linkage) between the clusters.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the intermediate node will have the Needleman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. That score is the similarity of the two organisms that were merged? Or the maximum similarity between any two organisms in the two clusters? It should be the similarity at which the two clusters were merged, which is the maximum similarity between any two organisms in the two clusters.\n\nSo we will:\n- Maintain a distance matrix (but we are using similarity, so we can work with a similarity matrix) and update it at each step using the single linkage (i.e., the maximum similarity between clusters).\n\nHowever, the standard hierarchical clustering algorithms (like in `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`) use a distance matrix. We can convert our similarity to a distance by: \n   distance = max_similarity - similarity\nBut note: we are told that the tree node height should be the Needleman-Wunsch score (the raw similarity). So when we build the tree, the height of the node should be the similarity value at which the merge happened.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the similarity matrix and use a modified version of the clustering that merges the two clusters with the highest similarity. We can use the `scipy` hierarchical clustering by providing a custom affinity matrix (which is similarity) and then convert it to a distance by: \n   distance = max_similarity + 1 - similarity   (to make sure it\'s non-negative and higher distance means less similar)\nBut then the linkage function will produce a dendrogram where the height of the merge is the distance. We then would have to convert the distance back to similarity? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the linkage matrix produced by `scipy` has the distances at which the clusters merge. We can store the similarity by: \n   similarity = max_similarity - distance\nBut then we lose the exact raw score? Because the linkage might use a different value.\n\nBut note: the instruction says that the intermediate node should have the Needleman-Wunsch score as its height. And that score is exactly the similarity value at which the two clusters were merged (which is the maximum similarity between any two leaves in the two clusters). \n\nHow can we do this without recoding the entire hierarchical clustering? \n\nWe can:\n1. Precompute a similarity matrix for the leaves (n x n).\n2. Use the similarity matrix to drive the clustering: we will use the single linkage method but with a custom function that uses the maximum similarity. But the standard single linkage in scipy uses minimum distance. So we can convert the similarity to distance by: \n      distance = max_sim - similarity\n   where max_sim is the maximum value in the similarity matrix (or even a value higher than the maximum to avoid negative distances?).\n\nBut then the height in the dendrogram (the distance at which clusters merge) would be: \n      height = max_sim - similarity_merge\n   and we want the height to be the similarity_merge? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the `scipy` hierarchical clustering and then adjust the linkage matrix to store the similarity? \n\nBut the problem also requires that we build a tree structure (for Newick and for the dendrogram drawing) and then we have to do cluster extraction. \n\nAnother idea: we can implement a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm ourselves that works on similarity and uses single linkage. Since the number of organisms might not be huge (maybe up to a few hundred?), we can do this.\n\nSteps for custom hierarchical clustering:\n\nLet:\n   n = number of organisms\n   S = n x n similarity matrix (for the leaves, we have this from step 1)\n   We will maintain:\n      - a list of current clusters (each cluster is a set of leaf indices, and we also want to build a tree structure with nodes that have height and children)\n      - a similarity matrix for the current clusters (initially, it\'s the same as S)\n\nBut we can use a priority queue to quickly find the highest similarity between clusters.\n\nHowever, for simplicity and because n is not huge, we can do:\n\n   clusters = [ [leaf_i] for i in range(n) ]   # each cluster is a list of leaf indices (or names)\n   active = set(range(n))   # active cluster indices\n   We\'ll create a new node for each merge. We\'ll store the tree as a binary tree.\n\n   We\'ll maintain a similarity matrix between clusters (initially the same as the leaf similarity matrix). But we only need the upper triangle.\n\n   Steps:\n      while there is more than one cluster:\n          find the two clusters i and j (i<j) with the maximum similarity value s.\n          create a new cluster k = merge of cluster i and j.\n          remove i and j from active and add k.\n          update the similarity matrix: the similarity between k and any other cluster l is max( S[i][l], S[j][l] ) [for single linkage]\n\nBut note: we don\'t have the full matrix for non-leaves? We are going to compute the similarity between the new cluster k and every other cluster l as the maximum of the similarities between any leaf in k and any leaf in l. But we have stored the precomputed leaf similarities? So we can compute the similarity between k and l by:\n   sim(k, l) = max{ sim(x,y) for x in k, y in l }\n\nBut we don\'t want to compute that by iterating every time (because it would be O(n^2) per merge, and overall O(n^3)). \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the entire leaf similarity matrix and then when merging, we can take for the new cluster k and any other cluster l: \n   sim(k, l) = max( sim(i, l), sim(j, l) )\n\nBut note: we stored the similarity between clusters as the maximum between any leaf in the two clusters. And we have for each cluster l, we have a vector of similarities to every leaf? But we don\'t. We have a matrix for the leaves, but we are updating the similarity between clusters? \n\nActually, we can maintain a 2D array for the current clusters? But we are reducing the number of clusters by one each time. We can use a full matrix but update it. The size is decreasing.\n\nBut the initial matrix is n x n. We can create a new matrix for the current clusters? The maximum number of clusters is n, then n-1, ... so the total operations would be O(n^3) which is acceptable for n up to a few hundred.\n\nGiven the constraints (likely not more than a few hundred species), we can do O(n^3).\n\nBut note: the instruction says "clean and efficient". We must be cautious. However, for n=100, O(n^3)=1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a priority queue or a heap to store the similarities between clusters? But updating the heap for every merge would require updating the similarities for every other cluster with the new cluster. And then we have to remove the entries for the two merged clusters. \n\nWe can do:\n\n   Let:\n      clusters: list of current clusters (each cluster has an id and a set of leaf indices)\n      sim_matrix: a 2D array of size (current_n, current_n) storing the similarity between clusters. Only the upper triangle is needed.\n\n   Steps:\n      current_n = n\n      while current_n > 1:\n          find (i, j) such that i < j and sim_matrix[i][j] is the maximum.\n          merge cluster i and j into a new cluster k.\n          create a new node in the tree with children = [cluster_i, cluster_j] and height = sim_matrix[i][j] (the similarity at which they merged).\n\n          Then, update the similarity matrix:\n             Remove rows and columns for i and j.\n             Add a new row and column for k.\n             For every other cluster l (l != i, j, and l < current_n-2), set:\n                 sim_matrix[k][l] = max(sim_matrix[i][l], sim_matrix[j][l])\n                 and similarly for l to k.\n\n          Then set current_n = current_n - 1.\n\nBut note: the similarity matrix is symmetric.\n\nWe\'ll represent the tree nodes as:\n\n   class Node:\n        def __init__(self, id, height, left=None, right=None, leaf_name=None):\n            self.id = id   # an identifier (could be a string for leaf, or an integer for internal)\n            self.height = height   # the similarity score at which this node was created (for leaf, we can set height=0? but leaves are not merged, so they don\'t have a merge height. However, in the dendrogram, the leaves are at the bottom. The internal node height is the similarity of the merge.\n            self.left = left\n            self.right = right\n            self.leaf_name = leaf_name   # only for leaves\n\nFor leaves, we can set:\n   node = Node(id=organism_name, height=0, leaf_name=organism_name)\n\nFor internal nodes, the height is the similarity at which the two clusters were merged.\n\nBut note: in the example, the intermediate node for "Horse" and "Dog" has height=1200.\n\nWe\'ll assign an arbitrary id for internal nodes (like a running index) and the height is the similarity value.\n\nAfter building the tree, we will have the root node.\n\nNow, for the Newick format:\n\n   For the first version (without distances): we just traverse the tree and output the leaf names.\n\n   For the second version (with distances): the distance from a node to its parent is the difference in heights? But note: in the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);"\n\n   How do we compute the branch lengths? \n\n   The branch length from a child to its parent is: parent.height - child.height.\n\n   Why? \n        For a leaf: \n            The leaf node has height=0? Then the branch length from leaf to its parent would be parent.height - 0 = parent.height.\n        But then for an internal node that has two children, the branch length to each child would be the same? \n\n   Actually, the tree we built is an ultrametric tree: the distance from the root to every leaf is the same? But that is not the case in general. However, in our clustering, the height of a node is the similarity at which the cluster was formed. The branch length from a node to its parent is the difference in height? \n\n   But note: the root node has the smallest similarity? Actually, the root node is the last merge and has the lowest similarity? And the leaves are at height 0. Then the branch length from a leaf to its parent is (parent.height - 0) and then from that parent to the next parent is (grandparent.height - parent.height), etc.\n\n   However, in the example: \n        We have two leaves A and B that form a parent at height 1. Then the branch for A is 1 and for B is 1? But in the example it\'s A:1 and B:2 -> that doesn\'t match.\n\n   Alternatively, the branch length might be the time from the child to the parent. But we don\'t have that. We only have the height (similarity) of the parent. And the child might be a leaf (with height 0) or an internal node (with its own height).\n\n   In our tree, the branch length from a node to its parent is the difference in the height of the parent and the height of the child.\n\n   So the Newick string for a node would be:\n        if leaf: \n            name + ":" + str(parent.height - 0)   # but we don\'t know the parent\'s height until we are building from the parent?\n        Actually, we traverse from the root down? \n\n   We can do a recursive function that, given a node and its parent\'s height, assigns the branch length as (parent_height - node.height). But at the root, we don\'t have a parent. We can set the root\'s parent height to be root.height? Then the root\'s branch length would be 0? But then the root\'s children would have branch length = root.height - child.height.\n\n   Alternatively, in the Newick string the root has no branch length? But the example has the entire subtree at the root having a branch length of 5: `(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5)`. The root has two children: the cluster (A,B) and the cluster (C,D). The branch from the root to (A,B) is 5? But that doesn\'t match the individual branch lengths.\n\n   Actually, the example might be built differently.\n\n   Let me clarify: in the example string `(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5`:\n        The root has two children: \n            one child is a leaf? Actually, no: \n            The structure: \n                (A, B) is a clade and (C,D) is a clade. \n                The root has two children: one is the clade (A,B) and the other is the clade (C,D). \n                The branch from the root to the (A,B) clade is 5, and the branch from the root to the (C,D) clade is 5? \n            But then inside the (A,B) clade, the branch from the (A,B) internal node to A is 1 and to B is 2? \n            That implies the (A,B) internal node is at distance 5 from the root, and then A is at 5+1=6 and B at 5+2=7? \n\n   This does not look ultrametric.\n\n   Our tree is built so that the height of an internal node is the similarity at which the merge happened. The branch lengths in terms of evolutionary time are not available. Therefore, we might only output the node heights (as the similarity) and then the branch lengths are computed as the difference in heights? \n\n   However, the problem says: "the second one should save both leaf nodes\' names and distances between branches in the tree". And "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number".\n\n   What distances? The branch lengths? \n\n   We have two options:\n        Option 1: The branch length from a node to its parent is the difference in the height (similarity) of the parent and the child. Then the leaf to the root would be the root\'s height (because the leaf\'s height is 0). But then the root\'s height is the total branch length from the root to the leaf? \n\n        Option 2: The branch length is the height of the parent node (the similarity at which the merge happened) minus the height of the child? But for a leaf, the leaf has no height? We set leaf height to 0.\n\n   Actually, in our tree, the internal node heights are increasing as we go up? Actually, the most similar pairs (high similarity) are merged first, so they are at the bottom. The root has the lowest similarity. So the root has the smallest height? Then the branch from a leaf to its first parent is the parent\'s height (because the leaf is at 0). Then from that parent to the next parent is (next parent\'s height - current parent\'s height). \n\n   Example: \n        Suppose we have three species: A, B, C.\n        Step1: merge A and B at similarity s1 (high).\n        Step2: merge (A,B) with C at similarity s2 (lower than s1).\n\n        Then the tree:\n            root (height = s2)\n               /   \\\n              /     \\\n          (A,B) (height=s1)  C (leaf, height=0)\n            /  \\\n           A    B\n\n        The branch from A to parent (A,B): s1 (because A is at 0 and parent at s1, so the branch length is s1 - 0 = s1).\n        The branch from (A,B) to root: s2 - s1.\n\n        The branch from C'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4226, 'total_tokens': 8322, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 4032}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 4032, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 194}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '012acc2f-8bc6-41f7-b39e-ce84160b230d', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--713e4ac4-4de5-419f-adc1-f7fe1858e098-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4226, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8322, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 4032}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}

**User:** Goal: Checking if provided solution covers all previously mentioned requirements.
Instruction: This was the end of coding tasks for this project. Right now all functionalities should be covered. The final code should start with reading input “blosumXX.json” and “organism.json” files and at the end print clusters for thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file to the standard output. Additionally, saving intermediate outputs as previously mentioned. This will be considered as a successful implementation. Now it is time to check if this implementation covers all requirements. Remember that implemented solutions must be of high quality. 
Expected Output: List of all previously provided requirements with short note on whether or not it is covered in the generated code.

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We have built the project step by step. Now, we need to check if all requirements are covered.\n\nRequirements from the entire conversation:\n\n1. **Role**: Act as a senior Python developer. We have been doing so by providing clean, efficient, and modular code with explanations.\n\n2. **Project Steps**:\n   a. **Task 1**: Calculate Needleman-Wunsch scores for all pairs of species from `organisms.json` using a BLOSUM matrix (from `blosumXX.json`). The scores are integers and stored in a structure (dictionary of dictionaries) and also saved to `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` in a flattened key-value format (with keys like "species1_species2").\n   b. **Task 2**: Build a phylogenetic tree (using hierarchical clustering with single linkage, but note we use similarity and merge the most similar first). The tree is built by merging nodes with the highest similarity (NW score). Each internal node has a height equal to the similarity score (NW score) of the merge. The tree is then saved in two Newick formats: one without distances (`tree_blosumXX_newick.nw`) and one with distances (`tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`). Also, a dendrogram is drawn and saved as `phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png` (horizontally, with x-axis as the NW distance).\n   c. **Task 3**: For each threshold in `thresholds.txt`, form clusters of species by cutting the tree at that threshold (which is a similarity threshold). The clusters are saved in `clusters_for_blosumXX.json` (key: threshold, value: list of clusters) and also printed to standard output.\n\n3. **Technical Requirements**:\n   - Python 3.11: We have written code compatible with 3.11 (using modern typing, but no version-specific features that break in 3.11).\n   - Libraries: We used `biopython` for alignment? Actually, in the first task we implemented NW ourselves. For the tree, we used `scipy` for hierarchical clustering? Actually, we built a custom tree because the requirement was to assign the height (NW score) at each merge and to have control over the Newick format and dendrogram. However, note that we did not use a library for clustering in the provided code. We built the tree manually by agglomerative clustering. Alternatively, we might use a library for hierarchical clustering? But the instruction said to merge the most similar first. We have a custom implementation for the tree building? Actually, in the code we generated, we did not show the tree building. Wait, we have to backtrack.\n\nWait, there\'s a gap: In the second task, we were asked to generate code for building the tree. However, in the subsequent goals we generated code for saving the tree in Newick and drawing the dendrogram. But we never generated the code for building the tree? \n\nLooking back at the conversation:\n\nAfter the first task (NW scores), we were asked for the second task: building the tree. We then provided a summary of the task. Then we were asked to generate code for building the tree. However, the next goal was about saving the tree to Newick format and then drawing the dendrogram. Then we moved to the third task.\n\nBut note: the goal "Generating a code for building a tree" was addressed. However, the code for building the tree was not generated in the conversation? Actually, I see that in the conversation we generated code for the first task and then for saving the scores. Then we skipped the tree building and went to saving the tree and drawing the dendrogram? That might be a problem.\n\nBut wait, the user\'s goal for the second task was split into two: \n- First, building the tree (with internal nodes having the NW score as height) \n- Then, saving the tree in two Newick formats and drawing the dendrogram.\n\nHowever, in the conversation we only generated code for saving the tree and drawing? We never generated the code for building the tree? That is a critical gap.\n\nBut note: in the goal "Generating a code for building a tree", we were asked to generate the code. However, the assistant\'s response was: "Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement". But we didn\'t have any code for the tree building at that point. Then the next goal was about saving the tree, which implies that the tree was built.\n\nSo, we must have generated the tree building code. Let me check the conversation:\n\nActually, after the first task, we generated `nw_alignment.py` that computes the scores. Then we were asked to build the tree. The next goal was: "Generating a code for building a tree". The instruction said: "The first step is to create a tree structure ...". We then provided an output that was a modification of the code? But the previous code was only for NW and saving scores. So we would have created a new file for tree building.\n\nBut the conversation history does not show the code for building the tree? It shows the code for saving the tree and drawing the dendrogram. That means we never generated the tree building code? \n\nThis is a critical point. Without the tree building code, we cannot proceed to save the tree or draw the dendrogram.\n\nBut note: the user\'s last goal was to check if all requirements are covered. We must have the tree building code in the final solution.\n\nSo, to cover the requirements, we must generate the tree building code. However, the user has ended the coding tasks and asked for a check. Therefore, we must note that the tree building code is missing and should be implemented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we used a library? The user allowed us to choose libraries. We could use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for the clustering? But note: the user said that we are to use the similarity scores (and we have to merge the most similar first) and assign the height as the NW score. The typical hierarchical clustering in `scipy` uses distances, not similarities. So we would have to convert our similarity to distance? The user said: "be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances". So we have two options:\n\n1. Convert the similarity to distance (for example, by using a transformation: distance = max_score - similarity) and then use `scipy` to do the clustering. Then we can get a linkage matrix and build the tree from that.\n\n2. Build our own agglomerative clustering that uses similarity and builds the tree with the required properties.\n\nGiven the requirement for control (and the fact that we need to assign the height as the similarity score at the merge) and that we need to output Newick with distances (which in our case are actually the heights, and the branch lengths would be the difference in heights), we might have to build a custom tree.\n\nBut note: the dendrogram drawing also requires the tree structure. We can use `scipy` to do the clustering and then use `to_tree` method to get a tree structure? But then we have to assign the heights appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `hierarchy` module from `scipy` and then use the linkage matrix to build the Newick tree? There are existing functions to convert linkage to Newick.\n\nBut the problem: the linkage in `scipy` uses distances. We have similarity. So we can convert the similarity matrix to a distance matrix by: \n\n   distance = max_similarity - similarity\n\nBut note: the maximum similarity might be unknown? Actually, we can set the distance as:\n\n   distance = (max_possible_score) - similarity\n\nBut the max_possible_score for two sequences? That is not trivial. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n   distance = -similarity\n\nand then use single linkage? But single linkage on negative similarities? That would not be standard.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the similarity matrix directly by setting the linkage method to \'complete\' or \'average\'? But the user specified single linkage? Actually, the user said "single linkage methodology", but we are using similarities. So we want to merge two clusters if there is a pair of elements in the two clusters with high similarity? That would be complete linkage? Actually, no:\n\n- Single linkage: distance between two clusters = min(distance between points in the two clusters) -> for similarity: max(similarity) would be the closest? Then we would want to use the maximum similarity between any two points in the clusters to decide the merge? Then it would be complete linkage in terms of similarity? \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn distance-based clustering (with single linkage) we merge the two clusters with the smallest minimum distance (i.e., the closest two points in the two clusters). \n\nIn similarity-based clustering, if we want the same behavior (merging clusters that have at least one pair of very similar points), then we would merge the two clusters that have the maximum similarity between any two points (which is equivalent to single linkage if we define distance as 1/similarity or -similarity). \n\nBut the user said "single linkage methodology", but we are using similarity. So we can define a distance as:\n\n   distance = max_score - similarity\n\nwhere max_score is the maximum possible similarity (which we can set as the maximum observed similarity? or the maximum possible for two sequences? It\'s not clear). Alternatively, we can set:\n\n   distance = -similarity\n\nand then use single linkage (which would merge the clusters with the smallest distance, i.e., the highest similarity). This is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan for tree building:\n\n1. Convert the similarity matrix to a distance matrix: D = -S (where S is the similarity matrix). But note: the similarity matrix is symmetric and the diagonal is not used? Also, we only have the upper triangular? \n\n2. Use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with method=\'single\' and the distance matrix (D) to get the linkage matrix.\n\n3. Then, we can build a tree from the linkage matrix. The height of each internal node is the distance at which the merge happens? But we want the similarity. So we can store the similarity as: similarity = - (distance) for the merge? Actually, the linkage matrix gives the distance at which the clusters are merged. So we can convert that back to similarity by: similarity = - (distance) if we used D = -S.\n\nBut note: the user wants the internal node to have a height of the similarity score (the raw NW score). So we can set the height of the internal node as: height = - (distance of merge). However, this might be negative? Actually, we used D = -S, so the distance of merge is negative of the similarity. Then the height would be: height = - (distance) = S, which is the similarity.\n\nBut wait: the linkage algorithm will merge the two clusters that have the smallest distance (which is the highest similarity). And the distance for the merge is the minimum distance between any two points in the two clusters? For single linkage, yes. So the distance of the merge is the maximum similarity in the cluster pair? Then the similarity at the merge is - (distance). \n\nSo we can build the tree and then assign the height (similarity) as - (the distance in the linkage matrix).\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` to get the tree and then when we output the Newick, we replace the distances (which are from the linkage) by the corresponding similarity? But note: the branch lengths in the Newick tree are usually the differences in heights? \n\nActually, the user wants two Newick formats: one without branch lengths and one with. And the branch lengths should be integers (the raw distances? or the differences in heights?).\n\nThe instruction for Newick: \n- Without distances: just the topology: "(A,B,(C,D));"\n- With distances: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);"\n\nIn the example, the numbers are branch lengths. In hierarchical clustering, the branch length for a leaf would be the difference between the height of the parent and the leaf (which is 0)? But wait, leaves are at height 0? Actually, we have to be consistent.\n\nIn our case, the height of a leaf is 0? And the height of an internal node is the similarity score at which the merge happened. Then the branch length from a node to its child is the difference in height between the node and the child.\n\nSo for a leaf, the branch length from the parent to the leaf would be the height of the parent (because the leaf is at 0). For an internal node, the branch length to its parent is the difference between the parent\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\nBut note: the root has no parent. So in the Newick tree, the root is at the top and the leaves are at the bottom. The distance from a node to its child is the decrease in height? Actually, the height increases as we go up. So the branch length from a parent to a child is (parent_height - child_height).\n\nSo in the Newick tree with distances, we would have:\n\n   (A: (root_height - leaf_A_height) ...) but leaf_A_height is 0? So A: root_height? That doesn\'t sound right.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the height of the leaf as the maximum height (the root height) and then the branch length would be the difference? That is not standard.\n\nActually, in a dendrogram, the leaves are at the bottom (height 0) and the root is at the top (height = max similarity). Then the branch from an internal node to its child is the difference between the node\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\nSo for a leaf, the branch length from its parent is (parent_height - 0) = parent_height? But wait, the leaf might be attached to an internal node that is not the root. The branch length should be the difference between the parent\'s height and the leaf\'s height (0). For an internal node that is a child of another internal node, the branch length is (parent_height - child_height).\n\nSo we can compute the branch lengths as differences.\n\nBut note: the entire tree\'s root is at the top, and the leaves are at the bottom (height 0). The internal nodes are at the height of the similarity score of the merge.\n\nTherefore, to get the Newick with branch lengths, we traverse the tree and for each edge from parent to child, the branch length is (parent.height - child.height). For the root, we don\'t have a parent, so we don\'t assign a branch length above the root? In the Newick tree, the root does not have a branch length above it.\n\nBut in the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);", the branch above the cluster (C,D) is 5? That would be the branch from the root to the (C,D) cluster? And the branch from the (C,D) cluster to C is 3 and to D is 4? This doesn\'t match our model.\n\nIn our model, the (C,D) cluster node has a height (say h1). The root has a height (say h2). Then the branch from the root to the (C,D) cluster is (h2 - h1). The branch from the (C,D) cluster to C is (h1 - 0) = h1? and similarly to D is h1? But then the example would have the same branch length for C and D? \n\nAlternatively, the branch lengths can be set arbitrarily? We have to follow the requirement: the x coordinates in the dendrogram should be the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances (similarity scores). So the horizontal bar for a cluster should be at the height of the similarity score.\n\nSo the branch lengths in the Newick tree are not the same as the horizontal bar positions? The Newick format with distances typically represents the branch lengths (the length of the vertical lines in a dendrogram) as the numbers? Actually, in a dendrogram, the horizontal bars are at the height of the merge. The vertical lines connect the merge bar to the child nodes. The length of the vertical lines is the difference between the merge height and the child\'s height.\n\nTherefore, the Newick tree with distances should have:\n\n   For a leaf: the branch length is the height of the parent (the merge bar) minus the leaf\'s height (0) = parent.height.\n   For an internal node: the branch length to a child is (node.height - child.height).\n\nBut wait, the internal node might have two children. The branch from the node to each child is (node.height - child.height). But the child could be a leaf or an internal node.\n\nSo we can build the Newick tree recursively, computing the branch lengths as the difference between the current node\'s height and the child\'s height.\n\nNow, back to the linkage matrix: we can use `scipy` to get the linkage, then convert it to a tree object (using `to_tree`), and then traverse that tree to build the Newick string. And at each node, we know the height (which is the distance in the linkage? but we want similarity, so we convert: similarity = - (distance) if we used D = -S).\n\nBut note: the linkage matrix gives the distance at which the merge occurs. We set the distance matrix as D = -S. So the merge distance d is - (similarity at the merge). Then the height (similarity) at the node is -d.\n\nSo the plan for the second task:\n\n1. Read the precomputed scores from `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` (or we can recompute? but the user said we will have the scores stored). We are going to read the scores.\n\n2. Build a distance matrix: for each pair (i, j), distance = -score(i, j). But note: the scores are symmetric and we have all pairs? Yes.\n\n3. Use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with the condensed distance vector (upper triangular) and method=\'single\'. The input to `linkage` is the condensed distance vector (1D array of the upper triangular part).\n\n4. Convert the linkage matrix to a tree object using `to_tree`.\n\n5. Then, we can write the Newick tree without distances: just the leaf names.\n\n6. For the Newick tree with distances, we traverse the tree and for each node, the branch length to a child is (parent.height - child.height). But note: the tree object from `to_tree` has the `dist` attribute? Actually, the `to_tree` returns a tree with distances as the linkage distances (which are the distances at the merge). But we want the branch lengths as the differences in heights? Actually, the linkage tree does not store the heights of the children? We can compute:\n\n   - The height of a leaf: 0 (by definition).\n   - The height of an internal node: similarity = - (linkage distance) [because we used D=-S]. But wait, the linkage distance for the merge is stored in the third column of the linkage matrix? and in the tree node, we have the `dist` for the node? Actually, the `dist` in the tree node from `to_tree` is the distance from the node to its children? Not exactly. The tree node in `scipy` has:\n        - `left`: left child\n        - `right`:'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4369, 'total_tokens': 8465, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 4160}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 4160, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 209}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '3070e321-4a6a-4a9d-972c-5f7e9bded904', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--f0f0effa-2950-4467-9c45-020e00cc45ae-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4369, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8465, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 4160}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We have completed the entire project in steps. Now we need to organize the code into a set of files and provide a project structure.\n\nThe project has the following steps:\n1. Read organisms.json and blosumXX.json.\n2. Compute Needleman-Wunsch scores for every pair of organisms and save as organisms_scores_blosumXX.json.\n3. Build a phylogenetic tree (using hierarchical clustering with single linkage, but note: we are using similarity scores, so we convert to distance by using negative or inverse? However, the instruction says: "merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score". In hierarchical clustering, we usually merge the closest (lowest distance). So we can convert similarity to distance by: distance = max_score - similarity, or use negative similarity? But note: the higher the similarity, the closer they are. So we can set distance = -similarity. Then the smallest distance (most negative) would be the highest similarity. However, in the tree building, we are creating a dendrogram where the height of the node is the similarity score (so we don\'t want to lose the original score).\n\nApproach for tree building:\nWe are going to use the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` library. However, note that the library expects a distance matrix. We will convert our similarity matrix to a distance matrix by: distance = max_similarity - similarity, but then the height of the node (which is the distance at which clusters are merged) would be in terms of this distance. But we want the height to be the original similarity score.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the similarity matrix directly and use a custom method? The problem says: "merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score". So we can use a distance matrix that is: distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or distance = -similarity. Then the merging will be in descending order of similarity (because ascending order of distance). Then when we get the linkage matrix, we can convert the distances in the linkage matrix back to similarity? But the height in the dendrogram (the third value in the linkage matrix) is the distance at which the clusters are merged. We want that height to be the similarity score.\n\nAlternatively, we can define the distance as: distance = max_similarity - similarity + 1 (to avoid zero) and then when building the tree, we can set the height as: max_similarity - distance + 1? This might get messy.\n\nAnother approach: we can use the similarity matrix and use the `linkage` function with the `method=\'single\'` but on a similarity matrix? The linkage function expects distances. So we must convert.\n\nBut note: the instruction says: "the tree should be created with a single-linkage clustering method, using Needleman-Wunsch scores as similarity metric". In single linkage, the distance between two clusters is the minimum distance between any two points in the clusters. But we have similarity: so the similarity between two clusters would be the maximum similarity between any two points? That would be complete linkage in terms of similarity? Actually, we want to use the maximum similarity (so the closest in terms of similarity) to merge clusters. This is equivalent to single linkage in a distance context if we set distance = -similarity.\n\nSo:\n   distance_matrix = -similarity_matrix\n\nThen we do hierarchical clustering with `method=\'single\'` on `distance_matrix`. Then the linkage matrix will have the distances as negative similarities. Then we can convert the heights (which are negative similarities) back to positive by: height = -distance? But then the height would be the similarity score.\n\nBut note: the height at which two clusters are merged is the value of the distance (which is -similarity) for the two clusters that are merged. Then if we want the height of the node to be the similarity score, we can set: height = - (distance value in the linkage matrix).\n\nAlternatively, we can adjust the linkage matrix: the third column (the distance) we replace by - (that value) to get the similarity.\n\nBut note: the linkage matrix from `scipy` does not allow negative distances. So we cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can define the distance as: max_similarity - similarity. Then the maximum distance is max_similarity - min_similarity. Then the height in the linkage matrix would be in the range [0, max_similarity - min_similarity]. Then we can convert the height to similarity by: similarity = max_similarity - height.\n\nBut then the height of the node would be the similarity? Actually, we want the height to be the similarity score at which the merge happened. The merge happened when the distance was \'d\', meaning the similarity was max_similarity - d. So we can set the height of the node to max_similarity - d.\n\nHowever, the problem states: "During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it should have Needleman-Wunsch score assigned as its height." So the height is the similarity score of the two clusters being merged? But in single linkage, the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two elements in the clusters? That is the same as the minimum distance in the distance matrix? Not exactly: if we define distance = max_similarity - similarity, then the single linkage distance between two clusters is the minimum distance (which corresponds to the maximum similarity) between any two points.\n\nSo the distance at which two clusters are merged (d) is: d = max_similarity - s, where s is the similarity between the two closest points in the clusters. Then the height we want is s = max_similarity - d.\n\nBut note: the linkage matrix returns d. So we can create a custom dendrogram that uses s as the height? Or we can adjust the linkage matrix? We can create a tree structure ourselves? But the instruction allows using libraries.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` but then adjust the linkage matrix: replace the third column (the distance) by max_similarity - distance. But then we have to be cautious because the distances in the linkage matrix are cumulative? Actually, the linkage matrix stores the distance between the two clusters at the time of merging. We can replace that value by the similarity score.\n\nBut note: the similarity score we are storing is the one that triggered the merge (the maximum similarity between any two points in the two clusters). That is exactly the original similarity value we want.\n\nSo steps for tree building:\n1. Read the scores from organisms_scores_blosumXX.json (or we can recompute? But we have the file so we can read from file to avoid recomputation).\n2. Create a distance matrix: \n   - Let max_score = maximum value in the scores (over all pairs) -> but note: the scores can be negative? We don\'t know. However, in the example they were positive. But to be safe, we can set max_score = max(scores.values()) if we use the flat scores? But our scores are stored in a nested dictionary.\n\n   Actually, we have a nested dictionary: {org1: {org2: score, ...}, ...}. We can flatten and take the max.\n\n   Then distance_matrix[i][j] = max_score - score(i,j)\n\n3. Use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with the condensed distance matrix (using `squareform` to convert to condensed form) and method=\'single\'.\n4. Then we adjust the linkage matrix: for each row in the linkage matrix, replace the distance (the third element) by: similarity = max_score - distance. This will be the height of the node.\n\nBut note: the linkage matrix has the following structure: [idx1, idx2, distance, count]. We are replacing the distance by the similarity score.\n\n5. Then we can use this adjusted linkage matrix for the Newick tree and the dendrogram.\n\nHowever, when we draw the dendrogram, we can set the `leaf_label_func` and so on. But the horizontal axis in the dendrogram will be the similarity? Actually, the dendrogram function uses the distance for the horizontal axis? We want the horizontal axis to be the similarity? The instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" -> but note: the dendrogram typically has the leaves on one axis and the height (the distance at which clusters are merged) on the other. In our case, we want the height to be the similarity.\n\nBut if we adjust the linkage matrix as above, then the dendrogram will show the similarity as the height? Yes, because we replaced the distance in the linkage matrix by the similarity.\n\nHowever, the dendrogram function expects the linkage matrix to have the distances (and non-decreasing). But if we replace the distances by the similarity, then the heights are decreasing? Because the higher the similarity, the lower the distance? So the dendrogram would be drawn upside-down? We can invert the axis? Or we can set the orientation to the right and then the height axis (which is now the x-axis) will be the similarity? But the instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" -> meaning the horizontal axis should represent the similarity? \n\nActually, the instruction says: "the dendrogram ... should be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". This implies that the horizontal axis should be the similarity score (the raw Needleman-Wunsch score) and the vertical axis is the species.\n\nSo we can set the orientation to \'left\' and then the height (which is the similarity) will be on the horizontal axis.\n\nBut note: in the dendrogram, the horizontal lines will be drawn at the similarity value (x-coordinate) for each merge.\n\nSo we can:\n   - Use the adjusted linkage matrix (with the similarity as the merge distance).\n   - Then when plotting, set `orientation=\'left\'` so that the species are on the y-axis and the similarity (x-axis) is the horizontal axis.\n\nBut note: the linkage matrix must have the distances (the third column) as the similarity? And then we tell the dendrogram to use that as the distance? Then when we set `orientation=\'left\'`, the horizontal lines will be drawn at the x-coordinate = similarity.\n\nHowever, the dendrogram function expects the distances to be increasing? But our similarity scores might not be increasing in the linkage matrix? Actually, the clustering process merges clusters in increasing order of distance (so decreasing order of similarity). Therefore, the linkage matrix (if we use the original distances) has non-decreasing distances. But we replaced the distances by the similarity, which are non-increasing? So the dendrogram would not plot correctly.\n\nAlternatively, we can keep the linkage matrix in terms of distances (without replacing by similarity) and then when plotting, we can invert the x-axis? But then the x-axis would be the distance, and we want similarity.\n\nWe can create a custom plot? Or we can set the x-axis to be the similarity by inverting the axis? But the instruction requires the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores to be the x-coordinate.\n\nGiven the complexity, we might build a custom dendrogram? But the instruction allows any style.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `to_tree` method from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` to convert the linkage matrix (with the original distance) to a tree structure and then write the Newick string ourselves, and then use a library like `ete3` to draw the tree? But that would add a dependency.\n\nAlternatively, we can build the tree ourselves? We are going to do hierarchical clustering. We can implement a simple single linkage clustering algorithm that stores the tree nodes and the height as the similarity.\n\nWe have a small number of species? The example had 2, but in reality it can be more. But if we have hundreds, we need an efficient algorithm.\n\nGiven the time, I think it\'s acceptable to use the `scipy` library and then adjust the linkage matrix by replacing the distance with the similarity. Then when plotting, we can set `orientation=\'left\'` and then the x-axis will be the similarity. But note: the dendrogram function will plot the distances (which we set as the similarity) and the leaves are ordered by the similarity? It might work.\n\nBut the problem is that the linkage matrix must have non-decreasing distances? And our similarities are non-increasing? So the linkage matrix we create (with the similarity as the third column) will be non-increasing? That is not allowed.\n\nSo we must use the original distance for the clustering and then when we want to show the dendrogram, we can set the x-axis to be the similarity? How? We can:\n\n   - Use the original distance matrix for clustering (with distance = max_score - score) and get the linkage matrix (with distances).\n   - Then when plotting, we can set the `leaf_label_func` and also change the tick labels on the x-axis? But the x-axis is the distance? We want the x-axis to show the similarity? We can invert the x-axis? But the positions of the merges are determined by the distance.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a custom dendrogram by traversing the tree? That might be too heavy.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the instruction says "you can draw this dendrogram in any style", we can plot the dendrogram with the distance (which is max_score - similarity) and then label the x-axis as similarity? But that would be misleading.\n\nAlternatively, we can plot the dendrogram with the x-axis being the distance, but then we can change the tick labels? For example, if the distance is d, then the similarity is max_score - d. But the positions of the merges are at d, and we want them at max_score - d? That would require changing the positions of the horizontal lines? That is complicated.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a custom hierarchical clustering that stores the tree with the similarity as the height. We\'ll implement a simple single linkage clustering that builds a tree. We\'ll create a tree node class and then use the similarity scores to merge.\n\nWe have the scores in a matrix. Steps:\n\n   - Start with each organism as a cluster (leaf node).\n   - The height of a leaf node is 0? But we want the height of the internal node to be the similarity score at which the two clusters are merged.\n\n   We\'ll maintain a list of clusters. Each cluster has: list of organisms (or leaf names), and the current similarity to other clusters? We\'ll maintain a distance matrix between clusters? But we are using single linkage: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two organisms in the two clusters.\n\n   We can use a priority queue to find the two clusters with the highest similarity.\n\n   Steps:\n\n     clusters = [ [org] for org in organisms ]\n     # We\'ll create a similarity matrix between clusters: initially the same as the organism similarity matrix.\n\n     Then we find the two clusters with the highest similarity. We merge them into a new cluster. The new cluster will have a node with height = that similarity.\n\n     Then we update the similarity matrix: for the new cluster and every other cluster, the similarity is the maximum similarity between any organism in the new cluster and any organism in the other cluster.\n\n     We do this until one cluster remains.\n\n   We\'ll create a tree node for each cluster:\n\n        class Node:\n            left: Node\n            right: Node\n            height: int   # the similarity score at which this node was created (for leaves, we can set height=0, but for internal nodes, the similarity score)\n            name: str   # for leaves, the organism name; for internal nodes, we don\'t need a name? Or we can generate one.\n\n   Then the root node will have the height of the last merge.\n\n   Then we can write the Newick string by traversing the tree. For a leaf: name:height? But the height of the leaf is 0? Then the distance from the leaf to the parent is the difference in heights? (parent.height - leaf.height) -> but that would be the parent.height.\n\n   For the Newick format with distances, we want the branch lengths to be the difference in heights? \n\n        (A:10, B:20, (C:30, D:40):50)\n\n   In this example, the distance from A to the root is 10? But the root has height 10? Then the branch length for A is 10 - 0 = 10.\n\n   For an internal node, the branch length from that node to its parent is the difference between the parent\'s height and the node\'s height.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        For a leaf: the branch length = (parent.height - leaf.height) but the leaf.height is 0? Then it\'s parent.height.\n\n        But note: the leaf doesn\'t store a parent. So we need to compute the branch length as the difference between the node\'s height and the parent\'s height? Actually, when writing the Newick string for a node, we write the branch length from the node to its parent.\n\n        We can traverse the tree and when we are at a node, we know its height and the parent\'s height? But we don\'t have parent pointers.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store the branch length as: for a node, the branch length = (node.height - parent.height) if it is not the root? But we don\'t have parent pointers.\n\n   We can design the tree building to store the parent? Or we can compute the branch length at the time of writing the Newick string by passing the parent\'s height.\n\n   We\'ll design:\n\n        def to_newick(node, parent_height=0):\n            if node is leaf:\n                return f"{node.name}:{node.height - parent_height}"\n            else:\n                # The branch length for this internal node to its parent is (node.height - parent_height)\n                # Then we need to write the children\n                children = [to_newick(child, node.height) for child in [node.left, node.right]]\n                return f"({\',\'.join(children)}):{node.height - parent_height}"\n\n        But note: the root node has no parent, so we don\'t write a branch length for the root? Actually, in Newick the root has no branch length.\n\n        We can do: if node is root, then we don\'t add the branch length? But the example: "(A,B,(C,D));" -> no branch lengths.\n\n        For the version with branch lengths: the root has no branch length? Actually, the root branch length is not defined. But the example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" -> the root has a branch length? Actually, the root is represented as a node with two children: (A, B) and another node (C,D). The root node has the branch length 5? But then the distance from the root to the (C,D) node is 5, and from the (C,D) node to C and D are 3 and 4 respectively? That doesn\'t add up.\n\n        Actually, the Newick format: \n            (A:1, B:2, (C:3, D:4)E:5)F;\n        But usually, the root is not drawn with a branch. So we can omit the root branch length? Or set it to 0.\n\n        We can return: \n            to_newick(root) returns the string without the trailing branch length for the root?'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4489, 'total_tokens': 8585, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 4352}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 4352, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 137}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '135e45e7-6bdb-4cfd-8b26-41fa0dc9be7d', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--ae9d3600-e12d-4974-9a08-1ffe7294e7ee-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4489, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8585, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 4352}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
