## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called ‚ÄúblosumXX.json‚Äù, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{‚Äúa‚Äù: -1, ‚Äúb‚Äù: -2, ‚Äúab‚Äù: -3, ‚Äúba": -3, ‚Äúaa‚Äù: 2, ‚Äúbb‚Äù: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

#content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 

We are given two input files:
1. organisms.json: a JSON file mapping species names (string) to their amino acid sequence (string).
2. blosumXX.json (where XX is 50 or 62): a JSON file representing the BLOSUM matrix. The keys are either
       - single characters (representing the cost for deleting that amino acid) or \n        - two concatenated characters (representing the substitution cost for the pair, in either order? note: the example has both "ab" and "ba", but in BLOSUM matrices the cost is symmetric so we expect the same value for "ab" and "ba". However, the example file structure shows both and with the same value. We must note that the algorithm may look for the pair in a specific order? But the example shows both orders. We have to check the requirement.
      However, note: the example says: 
      ```{ "a": -1, "b": -2, "ab": -3, "ba": -3, "aa": 2, "bb": 3 }```
       But in reality, BLOSUM matrices are symmetric. So we can assume that for any two different amino acids, the cost for substituting x with y is the same as y with x. Therefore, the matrix should have the same value for "ab" and "ba". However, the example file includes both.
      Important: When we use the matrix in the algorithm, we will be looking for the pair (char from sequence1, char from sequence2). We can form a key by concatenating the two characters in the order we see them? But note: the example has both "ab" and "ba". So we have two possibilities:
      
      Option 1: The matrix is stored with keys for every possible ordered pair? Then we can use the exact two characters in the order (from first sequence and second sequence) to form the key.\n   Option 2: The matrix is stored with unordered pairs? Then we might have to check both orders? But the example has both.\n\n However, the problem states: "a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other". It doesn\'t specify order. But the example includes both "ab" and "ba" with the same score. \n\n Since the example file has both, we can assume that the matrix is stored with keys for both orders? But that would be redundant. Alternatively, we can assume that the matrix is stored in a normalized way? However, the problem says we are given the file in that format.\n\n So, for safety, we can design the code to look for the key in the form of the two amino acids in the order we are substituting: i.e., from the first sequence to the second. But note: the example has both. So we can use the key as the two characters in the order: first character from sequence1 and second from sequence2.\n\n However, the example also has single-character keys for deletion.\n\n Steps for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm:\n\n We are going to compute the global alignment score for two sequences.\n\n We have:\n   gap_penalty: Actually, the problem doesn\'t specify a gap penalty? But note: the deletion cost is given by the matrix for a single character. So we can use that for the gap? But wait: the example says that the key is a single character and that represents the cost of deleting that character. However, in standard Needleman-Wunsch, we have a fixed gap penalty for opening a gap and extending? Or just a linear gap penalty? The problem doesn\'t specify.\n\n But note: the example file structure does not have a separate gap penalty. Instead, it has a cost for deleting a specific amino acid. This is unusual because in standard BLOSUM-based alignment, the gap penalty is fixed (or affine) and independent of the amino acid. However, here the deletion cost is per amino acid.\n\n So, we have to interpret:\n\n   When we have a gap in the first sequence (meaning we are inserting a gap in the first sequence and thus aligning a character in the second sequence with a gap), the cost is the deletion cost for that character in the second sequence? Similarly, a gap in the second sequence would cost the deletion cost for the corresponding character in the first sequence?\n\n But note: the problem says: "deleting that character". So if we delete a character, we are effectively skipping it in one sequence and aligning it with a gap. So:\n\n   For a gap in sequence A (meaning we are aligning a gap in A with a character in B): we use the deletion cost for the character in B? \n   For a gap in sequence B (aligning a character in A with a gap in B): we use the deletion cost for the character in A.\n\n However, the problem does not specify whether the deletion cost is for the character that is being deleted (i.e., the one that is skipped) or for the one that is aligned? It says "deleting that character". So if we delete a character from sequence A, then we are aligning a gap in A with the next character in B? Actually, no: in the alignment, if we delete a character from A, we are effectively skipping it and we will have a gap in A at that position. So the cost for that gap event is the deletion cost for the amino acid that was in A? Similarly, for a gap in B, we are skipping an amino acid in B, so we pay the deletion cost for that amino acid in B.\n\n Therefore, we can define:\n\n   gap_penalty_for_char(c) = score from the matrix for the single-character key c.\n\n But note: the matrix gives negative scores for deletions (as in the example: -1, -2). So a deletion is penalized.\n\n So in the algorithm:\n\n   When we have a gap in sequence A (so we are aligning a gap in A with character b_j in B), we use gap_penalty = blosum_dict[b_j]   [if we interpret as the deletion cost for the amino acid in the sequence that is present? Actually, the sequence that is present is B, but we are deleting nothing from A? Let me re-think.]\n\n Actually, the problem states: "deleting that character". So if we are aligning a gap in A with a character b_j in B, then we are effectively deleting the character b_j from the alignment? That doesn\'t make sense because b_j is present. Alternatively, we are deleting the character from the sequence that has the gap? That sequence doesn\'t have the character.\n\n Clarification: In the alignment, we are comparing two sequences. When we have a gap in one sequence, we are saying that the other sequence has an insertion (or equivalently, the sequence with the gap has a deletion). So:\n\n   - If we have a gap in sequence A at a position, that means we are deleting the amino acid from A at that position? But wait: in the alignment, we are not skipping an amino acid in A? Actually, we are: because we are moving along sequence B without taking an amino acid from A. So the deletion event is the deletion of the amino acid from A? But in that position, we don\'t have an amino acid from A? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might mean that the deletion cost for an amino acid is used when that amino acid is aligned with a gap. So:\n\n   - When aligning amino acid \'a\' from sequence A with a gap (i.e., a deletion event for \'a\'), we use the deletion cost for \'a\' (from the matrix: key \'a\').\n\n   - Similarly, when aligning amino acid \'b\' from sequence B with a gap (deletion event for \'b\'), we use the deletion cost for \'b\'.\n\n So in the algorithm:\n\n   For a gap in the first sequence (meaning we are using a gap in the first sequence and the amino acid from the second sequence), we are effectively deleting the amino acid from the first sequence? Actually, no: the first sequence doesn\'t have an amino acid at that position? \n\n Let me represent an alignment:\n\n   Sequence A: A[0], A[1], ... A[i-1]\n   Sequence B: B[0], B[1], ... B[j-1]\n\n   We build a matrix F(i, j) for the score of aligning the first i characters of A and the first j characters of B.\n\n   The recurrence:\n\n   F(i, j) = max {\n        F(i-1, j-1) + substitution_score(A[i-1], B[j-1]),\n        F(i-1, j) + gap_cost_A,   // gap in B: we are skipping A[i-1] -> deletion of A[i-1] -> so use deletion cost for A[i-1]\n        F(i, j-1) + gap_cost_B    // gap in A: we are skipping B[j-1] -> deletion of B[j-1] -> use deletion cost for B[j-1]\n   }\n\n So:\n   gap_cost_A = blosum_dict[A[i-1]]   ? \n   gap_cost_B = blosum_dict[B[j-1]]\n\n However, note: the problem says the deletion cost for a character is given. So if we skip a character in A (because we are inserting a gap in A? Actually, we are aligning a gap in A with a character in B), then we are effectively deleting the character from A? But wait, the character from A is not at that position? Actually, we are at a state where we are considering the next character of B but we have run out of A? Or we are skipping that character in A? \n\n Actually, in the recurrence, the gap in A (meaning we are taking a character from B and skipping it in A) corresponds to deleting a character from A? Not exactly: we are not deleting a character that is present? We are just not matching it? But in the standard model, we are allowed to skip characters arbitrarily? \n\n This is ambiguous. However, the problem states that the deletion cost for an amino acid is given. And in the alignment, when we skip an amino acid in one sequence (by inserting a gap in the other), we are effectively deleting that amino acid? \n\n Therefore, we will use:\n\n   When we skip an amino acid \'a\' in sequence A (by inserting a gap in A and taking an amino acid from B), we pay the deletion cost for \'a\'. Similarly for skipping an amino acid in B.\n\n But note: in the recurrence above, when we are at F(i, j), and we skip A[i-1] (by taking a gap in B? Actually, no: skipping A[i-1] would be done by moving from F(i-1, j) to F(i, j) without taking anything from B? That would be a gap in B? And we are skipping A[i-1]? So we pay the deletion cost for A[i-1]. Similarly, skipping B[j-1] (by taking a gap in A) would pay the deletion cost for B[j-1].\n\n However, in the recurrence:\n\n   F(i-1, j) -> F(i, j): we are taking the next character from A (A[i-1]) and skipping it? And we are not taking any character from B? So we are aligning A[i-1] with a gap? Then we pay the deletion cost for A[i-1].\n\n   Similarly, F(i, j-1) -> F(i, j): we are taking B[j-1] and skipping it? So we pay the deletion cost for B[j-1].\n\n But wait: in the standard Needleman-Wunsch, we have a fixed gap penalty. Here, the gap penalty is per the amino acid that is being skipped? So it\'s not fixed? \n\n Therefore, we have:\n\n   substitution_score(a, b) = blosum_dict[a+b]   OR blosum_dict[b+a]? \n\n   Since the matrix has both keys? Actually, the example has both "ab" and "ba". So we can form the key by the two amino acids in the order: first the one from the first sequence, then the one from the second sequence? Then we look for the key = a+b.\n\n   But note: the example has both "ab" and "ba". So if we form the key as a+b, then we can use that. And the matrix should have that key. Similarly, for a gap event: we use the single character.\n\n Steps for the task:\n\n   We are to compute the Needleman-Wunsch score for every pair of species in the organisms.json.\n\n   Inputs:\n        organisms.json: dictionary { species: sequence_string }\n        blosumXX.json: dictionary with keys as described.\n\n   We have to do:\n\n        species = list of species names\n        sequences = list of the corresponding amino acid sequences\n\n        For each pair (i, j) (with i <= j? or all pairs? we need both (i,j) and (j,i) but the score should be symmetric? Actually, the alignment score might not be symmetric? But the algorithm is symmetric? Actually, the deletion cost for a specific amino acid is fixed, and the substitution cost for (a,b) is the same as (b,a)? But the matrix has the same value for "ab" and "ba", so yes.\n\n        However, note: the deletion cost for amino acid \'a\' is the same regardless of which sequence it comes from? So the score for aligning A and B should be the same as for B and A.\n\n   Therefore, we can compute the upper triangular matrix and then mirror it.\n\n   But note: the algorithm is symmetric? \n\n   We\'ll compute a distance matrix? Actually, we are computing the alignment score. Then we will convert to a distance later? The problem says: "Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree". The score is a similarity? Then we convert to distance by: distance = max_score - score? or 1 - normalized score? But the problem doesn\'t specify.\n\n   For now, we just compute the raw alignment score.\n\n   Important: we must be efficient because the number of pairs is O(n^2) and each alignment is O(len1 * len2). The sequences are amino acid sequences (so 20 letters) and the lengths might be long? We have to optimize.\n\n   We are to write production code, so we must consider:\n\n        - Using dynamic programming with O(n*m) per pair.\n        - We might need to optimize by using efficient data structures? But the DP is straightforward.\n\n        However, note: the sequences might be long (hundreds or thousands of amino acids). And we have many species? If we have 100 species, then we have 4950 pairs? and each alignment takes (len1 * len2). If the average length is 1000, then 1000*1000 = 1e6 per pair, so 4950 * 1e6 = 4.95e9 operations? That might be slow in Python.\n\n        We might need to use:\n\n          - Parallel processing? \n          - Or optimized libraries? But the requirement is to write the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a library? But the requirement is to implement.\n\n        The problem says: "Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs."\n\n   We are going to write a function for the Needleman-Wunsch alignment that takes two sequences and the scoring dictionary and returns the alignment score.\n\n   Steps for the function:\n\n        Let A and B be the two sequences (strings of amino acids).\n        Let n = len(A), m = len(B)\n        Create a 2D array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1)\n\n        Initialize:\n            dp[0][0] = 0\n            For i from 1 to n:\n                dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + blosum_dict[A[i-1]]   # because we are deleting A[i-1] for each gap in B? Actually, we are aligning A[0..i-1] with nothing? So we delete all of them.\n            For j from 1 to m:\n                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + blosum_dict[B[j-1]]\n\n        Then for i from 1 to n:\n            for j from 1 to m:\n                match_score = blosum_dict[A[i-1] + B[j-1]]   # key = A[i-1] + B[j-1] -> two characters\n                diag = dp[i-1][j-1] + match_score\n                up = dp[i-1][j] + blosum_dict[A[i-1]]   # gap in B: we are skipping A[i-1] -> deletion cost for A[i-1]\n                left = dp[i][j-1] + blosum_dict[B[j-1]]   # gap in A: skipping B[j-1] -> deletion cost for B[j-1]\n                dp[i][j] = max(diag, up, left)\n\n        Then the score is dp[n][m]\n\n   However, note: the scoring dictionary might not have the key for every pair? We have to be cautious.\n\n   Also, the example matrix has both "ab" and "ba", so we are using the key as A[i-1]+B[j-1]. But what if the matrix doesn\'t have that key? The problem doesn\'t specify. We must assume that the matrix is complete? Or we should check and throw an error?\n\n   Since the matrix is provided (BLOSUM50 or BLOSUM62) we can assume it has all amino acids? But the sequences are amino acids, so they are in the set of 20. And the matrix should have all pairs? \n\n   However, the deletion cost for an amino acid is given by the single-character key. So we must have a key for every amino acid that appears in the sequences.\n\n   We must validate the sequences: do they contain only the 20 standard amino acids? The problem doesn\'t say. We might have to handle non-standard? But the BLOSUM matrices typically cover the 20 standard. So if we encounter an unknown amino acid, we should throw an error? Or the problem says the sequences are amino acid sequences? We\'ll assume they are the standard 20.\n\n   But note: the BLOSUM matrix might use the one-letter codes. So the sequences must be in upper case? The example sequences are in upper case.\n\n   We\'ll assume the sequences are in upper case and the matrix keys are in lower case? Or the same case? The example: "a", "b" in the matrix, but the sequences are in upper case? The example sequences: "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL" -> all uppercase.\n\n   The problem doesn\'t specify the case of the keys in the matrix. But the example matrix keys are in lower case? \n\n   We must be cautious: if the matrix keys are in lower case and the sequences are in upper case, we need to convert? \n\n   The problem says: "Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ..." and the sequences are in uppercase. The example for the matrix: keys "a", "b", etc. in lower case.\n\n   Therefore, we

Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from ‚Äúorganism.json‚Äù calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in ‚ÄúblosumXX.json‚Äù file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string ‚Äúaabaab‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies1‚Äù and another string ‚Äúababaa‚Äù for key ‚Äútestspecies2‚Äù, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

### Solution: Saving Pairwise Alignment Scores to JSON Files

I'll modify the previous solution to add JSON output functionality while maintaining the core Needleman-Wunsch implementation. Here's the updated file structure:

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alignment/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nw.py          # Core algorithm
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scorer.py      # BLOSUM scoring logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ io/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reader.py      # Input file handling
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ writer.py      # New JSON output handler
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py            # Updated orchestration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # Dependencies
```

### 1. New JSON Writer Module
**File: `io/writer.py`**
```python
import json
import os

def save_scores(scores: dict, blosum_path: str) -> str:
    """Save pairwise scores to JSON file with matrix-specific filename
    
    Args:
        scores: Dictionary of {species_pair: score}
        blosum_path: Path to BLOSUM matrix file
        
    Returns:
        Path to generated output file
    """
    # Extract matrix name (blosum50/blosum62)
    matrix_name = os.path.basename(blosum_path).split('.')[0]
    output_file = f"organisms_scores_{matrix_name}.json"
    
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(scores, f, indent=2)
    
    return output_file
```

### 2. Updated Main Orchestrator
**File: `main.py`**
```python
import argparse
import itertools
from typing import Dict, Tuple
from alignment.nw import NeedlemanWunsch
from alignment.scorer import BlosumScorer
from io.reader import load_organisms, load_blosum_matrix
from io.writer import save_scores  # NEW IMPORT

def compute_pairwise_scores(
    organisms: Dict[str, str],
    scorer: BlosumScorer
) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Calculate NW scores for all species pairs"""
    pairwise_scores = {}
    species = sorted(organisms.keys())
    
    for (species1, species2) in itertools.combinations(species, 2):
        seq1 = organisms[species1]
        seq2 = organisms[species2]
        nw = NeedlemanWunsch(scorer)
        score = nw.align(seq1, seq2)
        pair_key = f"{species1}_{species2}"
        pairwise_scores[pair_key] = score
    
    return pairwise_scores

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--organisms', type=str, required=True,
                        help='Path to organisms.json')
    parser.add_argument('--blosum', type=str, required=True,
                        help='Path to BLOSUM matrix JSON')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Load input data
    organisms = load_organisms(args.organisms)
    blosum_matrix = load_blosum_matrix(args.blosum)
    scorer = BlosumScorer(blosum_matrix)

    # Compute scores
    pairwise_scores = compute_pairwise_scores(organisms, scorer)
    
    # NEW: Save results to matrix-specific JSON file
    output_path = save_scores(pairwise_scores, args.blosum)
    print(f"Saved {len(pairwise_scores)} pairwise scores to {output_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Changes:
1. **New Output Module**:
   - Created `io/writer.py` for file output responsibilities
   - Filename dynamically generated from BLOSUM matrix name
   - Output format: `{"species1_species2": score, ...}`

2. **Main Script Updates**:
   - Added output step after score calculation
   - Maintained separation of concerns (I/O vs business logic)
   - Added confirmation message with output path

3. **Preserved Core Functionality**:
   - Needleman-Wunsch algorithm remains unchanged
   - BLOSUM scoring logic untouched
   - Input handling identical

### Execution Flow:
1. Load organisms and BLOSUM matrix
2. Calculate all pairwise alignment scores
3. Generate filename based on BLOSUM version
4. Save scores as JSON with species-pair keys
5. Output confirmation message

### Usage:
```bash
python main.py \
  --organisms organisms.json \
  --blosum blosum50.json
# Creates organisms_scores_blosum50.json
```

This modification maintains the production-ready standards while adding the requested output functionality. The solution remains efficient with O(n¬≤) pairwise operations and O(1) score lookups in the output dictionary.
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are moving to the second task: building a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering with the similarity scores (Needleman-Wunsch) we computed.\n\nKey points from the instruction:\n1. We have pairwise similarity scores (higher = more similar) for species pairs.\n2. We want to build a phylogenetic tree by repeatedly merging the most similar pairs (agglomerative clustering with single linkage? but note: the instruction says "merge nodes with highest similarity"). However, note that the instruction also says it is similar to agglomerative hierarchical clustering with single linkage, but we are using similarity, not distance.\n3. Important: Most libraries work on distances (where lower is closer) but we have similarities (higher is closer). We must convert similarity to distance appropriately? Or adjust the algorithm to work with similarities.\n4. The tree structure must be built in a way that we can later:\n   a. Cut the tree at different thresholds (which are in the range of the original similarity scores) to form clusters.\n   b. Draw a dendrogram.\n   c. Save the tree in Newick format.\n\nApproach:\n- Since we are building a tree from the bottom up by merging the most similar pairs, we are essentially doing hierarchical clustering with a custom linkage criterion that uses similarity (maximize similarity) rather than minimizing distance.\n- We can convert our similarity scores to distances by: distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or (max_similarity - similarity + 1) to ensure positivity? But note: the instruction says that later steps will use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores. Therefore, we must preserve the original similarity scores in the tree.\n\nHow to handle:\n- We can use the similarity scores directly in our clustering algorithm. However, standard hierarchical clustering algorithms (like the one in `scipy`) use dissimilarity (distance). So we have two options:\n  Option 1: Convert similarity to distance. But then the thresholds for cutting the tree would be in the distance space, not the original similarity. This would be problematic because the user wants to use thresholds in the original similarity range (e.g., 850, 910, 980). So we cannot lose the original similarity.\n\n  Option 2: Implement a custom hierarchical clustering that works with similarity and merges based on maximum similarity. We can do this by modifying the standard algorithm to use similarity (and then for the linkage, we use the maximum similarity as the criterion for merging). This is feasible but requires a custom implementation.\n\nGiven the requirement to preserve the original similarity scores and to use them for thresholding, it seems we need to build a tree that stores the similarity at each merge. Then, when we cut the tree at a similarity threshold, we can interpret: clusters are formed by the branches that have a similarity score (i.e., the value at which they were merged) above the threshold.\n\nWe are also required to output the tree in Newick format and to draw a dendrogram. Therefore, we need to build a tree structure that can be traversed for these purposes.\n\nPlan for the task:\n1. We have a file with pairwise similarity scores: `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` (from the first task). We can load this.\n2. We need to build a tree (hierarchical clustering) by:\n   a. Starting with each species as a leaf node.\n   b. Finding the pair with the highest similarity (which we have from the JSON) and merge them into a new node. The new node will have a branch to each of the two merged nodes, and the branch length? Actually, in the context of the tree, we are going to store the similarity at which the merge happened. But note: in a dendrogram, the height of the node is usually the distance (or in our case, we might want to represent it as the inverse of similarity?).\n\n   However, the instruction says: "Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors" and we are building a phylogenetic tree. The Newick format typically includes branch lengths (which are usually time or substitutions). In our case, we don\'t have time, but we have similarity. But note: the similarity score is for the entire sequence and is an alignment score. We cannot directly use it as branch length because branch length should be additive.\n\n   We must decide: what will be the branch length? The problem doesn\'t specify. But for the dendrogram drawing and Newick, we need to assign a height (or distance) to each node.\n\n   Important: The instruction says that the thresholds are in the original similarity scores. So we must store the similarity at which each merge occurs. However, for the dendrogram, we can set the height of the node to be (max_similarity - current_similarity) so that the most similar (highest score) are at the bottom? Then the root would be at height (max_similarity - min_similarity). This way, when we cut at a similarity threshold T, we can convert to a height: h = max_similarity - T, and then cut the dendrogram at h.\n\n   Alternatively, we can store the similarity as the node\'s attribute and then when plotting, set the node\'s position (height) to be the similarity? Then the dendrogram would have the y-axis as similarity. This is non-standard (usually it\'s distance) but acceptable.\n\n   The requirement for Newick: we can store the similarity at the node? But Newick typically uses branch lengths. We can set the branch length to be the difference in similarity between the parent and the child? However, the problem does not specify.\n\n   Let\'s re-read: "the tree will show branching in evolutionary history". The internal nodes are common ancestors. We don\'t have a time scale, so we use the similarity as a proxy for the time (higher similarity means closer in time). Therefore, the height of a node should be the similarity? Then when we merge two nodes, the new node is created with a similarity score equal to the similarity of that pair? Then the branch from the new node to each child would be of length zero? That doesn\'t seem right.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the similarity to compute a distance: \n        distance = max_possible_similarity - similarity\n\n   But note: the max_possible_similarity is not known. It could be the maximum alignment score for each sequence? That would be expensive to compute.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since the instruction says that the thresholds are in the original similarity scores, I propose:\n\n   - We build the tree by storing the similarity at which each merge occurs as the node\'s value (which we call the node\'s height = similarity). Then the dendrogram will have the y-axis as the similarity score. This way, when we cut at a threshold T (a similarity value), we can look at the tree and form clusters by grouping all the leaves that are connected by nodes with similarity >= T.\n\n   For the branch lengths in the Newick tree, we can set the branch from a node to its child as the difference in similarity between the node and the child? But note: the leaves have no similarity of their own (they are not merged). We can assign the leaves to have a similarity of infinity? Then the branch length from a leaf to its parent would be (parent_similarity - leaf_similarity) which is not defined.\n\n   Alternatively, we can set the branch length from a node to a child to be the difference in the node\'s similarity and the child\'s similarity? For a leaf, we have to assign a base similarity? We don\'t have that.\n\n   Another idea: we don\'t have branch lengths, we only have the similarity at the merge events. Therefore, we can represent the tree as a node with a height (the similarity at which it was formed) and the children. The branch from the node to the child is then (parent_height - child_height). For the leaves, we can set their height to 0? Then the branch length from the leaf to the first parent would be (parent_height - 0). But note: the leaf didn\'t merge at 0, so this is arbitrary.\n\n   However, the instruction does not specify branch lengths. It only says we need to save the tree in Newick format. The Newick format can have internal nodes labeled and branch lengths optional. We can set:\n\n        (child1:branch_length, child2:branch_length)node_name:0\n\n   But what branch_length? We don\'t have that information. We only have the similarity at the merge.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, we will focus on the clustering and the dendrogram drawing. For the Newick format, we can output the tree without branch lengths? Or set all branch lengths to 1? But that would be arbitrary.\n\n   The instruction says: "save it in text Newick format". It doesn\'t specify if branch lengths are required. We can output the tree topology and use the similarity as the node label? Then the branch lengths can be omitted? Or set to 0? \n\n   Let me check: the requirement for the dendrogram and for the threshold-based clustering is more critical. For the clustering: we want to cut the tree at a similarity threshold. We don\'t need branch lengths for that.\n\n   Therefore, for the purpose of this task, we will:\n\n   - Build a tree where each node has:\n        - children (if it\'s an internal node)\n        - the set of leaves (species) under that node (for clustering)\n        - the similarity score at which the node was created (the similarity of the two clusters that were merged to form it)\n\n   - We can then traverse this tree to form clusters at a threshold: we traverse the tree and stop when the node\'s similarity is below the threshold? Actually, we want clusters that have similarity above the threshold. So we cut the tree at the threshold: any node that has a similarity score >= threshold remains merged, but if the node\'s similarity is below the threshold, we break the merge? Actually, we want to break at the point where the merge happened at a similarity below the threshold? Then the clusters are the children of that node.\n\n   But note: the tree is built from the bottom up. The leaves are at the highest similarity? Actually, the leaves are individual species and we haven\'t merged them, so they don\'t have a similarity. The first merge happens at the highest similarity we have in our pairwise scores. Then we go upwards to lower similarities.\n\n   Therefore, when we set a threshold T, we want to break the tree at the nodes where the similarity is less than T. Then the clusters are the subtrees above the node (i.e., the children of that node) that have not been broken.\n\n   However, the standard way in hierarchical clustering is to form clusters by cutting the dendrogram at a certain height (which in our case is similarity). We can do:\n\n        clusters = {}\n        current_id = 0\n        def traverse(node, threshold):\n            if node.similarity >= threshold: \n                # then we consider the node as merged and we don\'t break, so we return the leaves of the whole subtree\n                return set(node.leaves)\n            else:\n                # break the node: then we return multiple clusters from the children\n                left_cluster = traverse(node.left, threshold)\n                right_cluster = traverse(node.right, threshold)\n                # but note: the children might be internal nodes that are broken further? Actually, we break at the first node that falls below the threshold?\n                # Actually, we want to break at every node below the threshold? Then we return the clusters from the two children as separate.\n                # But we cannot simply return two sets because the function returns one set? We need to return a list of sets.\n\n        This recursive approach doesn\'t work for multiple clusters.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a method similar to `fcluster` in scipy, which uses the linkage matrix and the threshold to assign clusters.\n\n   Given the complexity, I propose we use the following:\n\n   We build the tree and represent it as a linkage matrix? But we are using similarity, not distance. We can convert the similarity to a distance by: distance = max_similarity - similarity. Then we can use standard hierarchical clustering tools? But then the threshold for cutting would be in distance: threshold_distance = max_similarity - T. Then we can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster` with threshold_distance.\n\n   However, the instruction says: "It is extremely important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores" because further steps use raw scores. But if we store the linkage matrix in terms of distance, then we lose the original similarity? We can store the similarity in the linkage matrix as the third column? Actually, the linkage matrix in scipy has the following columns: [node1, node2, distance, node_count]. We can create a custom linkage matrix that uses similarity in the third column? Then we can write our own fcluster-like function that uses similarity?\n\n   Alternatively, we can build a custom tree and then traverse it for clustering and for Newick.\n\n   Given the requirements for Newick and dendrogram drawing, and the need to use raw similarity in clustering, we might need to implement a custom hierarchical clustering algorithm that:\n\n   - Starts with each species as a cluster.\n   - At each step, find the two clusters with the maximum similarity. The similarity between two clusters is defined as the maximum similarity between any pair of elements in the two clusters (single linkage). But note: we only have pairwise similarities for the original species. We don\'t have similarities for clusters. How do we compute the similarity between clusters? We can use the single linkage: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two elements, one from each cluster.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Let D be the dictionary of pairwise similarities for the original pairs (from the JSON).\n\n   We\'ll maintain:\n        clusters: a list of current clusters (each cluster is a set of species names, and we can also assign an id for the node)\n        current_similarities: a dictionary that maps a pair of clusters (by id) to the similarity between them (which we compute as the max similarity between any two species in the two clusters)\n\n   But note: the number of clusters decreases at each step. We start with n clusters, and we do n-1 merges.\n\n   We can use a priority queue to quickly find the pair of clusters with the maximum similarity.\n\n   Steps:\n\n        clusters = [ {species} for each species ]\n        # The similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two species in the two clusters? But note: we only computed similarities for the original species pairs. We don\'t have similarities for clusters. However, we can define the similarity between cluster A and cluster B as max{ similarity(a,b) for a in A, b in B }.\n\n        We can precompute a matrix for the original species? But then update it? Actually, we can use the initial pairwise scores and then update the similarity between clusters as we merge? But note: we are using single linkage: the similarity between cluster A and cluster B is the maximum similarity between any two original species (a,b) with a in A, b in B. So we can store for each pair of clusters the current similarity, and when we merge two clusters, we update the similarities for the new cluster with every other cluster by taking the maximum similarity between the new cluster and the other cluster? \n\n        Example: \n          clusters: A, B, C, ... \n          We merge A and B into a new cluster AB. Then the similarity between AB and C is max( sim(a,c) for a in A and c in C, sim(b,c) for b in B and c in C ) = max( max(sim(A,C)), max(sim(B,C)) )\n\n        Since we have stored the similarity between clusters as the maximum of the original pairs, we can update:\n\n          sim(AB, C) = max( sim(A,C), sim(B,C) )\n\n        So we can update without recomputing over all pairs.\n\n   However, we only have the original species pairs. We don\'t have the similarity between a cluster and another cluster? We can precompute the entire similarity matrix for the original species, and then when we form clusters, we can maintain a matrix (or dictionary) of the current similarities between clusters.\n\n   Implementation:\n\n        Let clusters be a list of sets.\n        Let cluster_ids = [id1, id2, ...] (each cluster has an id and a set of species)\n\n        We\'ll create a similarity matrix between clusters, but we don\'t want to use a full matrix because it\'s O(n^2) and n is the number of clusters (which decreases). We can use a priority queue.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a dictionary that maps (id1, id2) to similarity. But then updating when merging two clusters would require updating for every other cluster.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          1. Precompute the initial similarity for every pair of clusters (which are the original species) from the JSON data. For two clusters that are singletons {a} and {b}, the similarity is sim(a,b) (which we have from the JSON).\n\n          2. We maintain a priority queue (max heap) of (similarity, id1, id2). But note: we have to avoid duplicate pairs (id1 < id2).\n\n          3. At each step:\n                pop the heap to get the two clusters (c1, c2) with the highest similarity.\n                merge c1 and c2 to form a new cluster c_new = c1 ‚à™ c2.\n                Remove all entries in the heap that involve c1 or c2.\n                For every other cluster c3:\n                    compute the similarity between c_new and c3: \n                         sim(c_new, c3) = max( sim(c1, c3), sim(c2, c3) )\n                    push (sim(c_new, c3), id_new, id3) into the heap (with id_new < id3 to avoid duplicates)\n\n          4. Record the merge: we will build a tree. We can create a node for c_new that has children c1 and c2, and the similarity of the merge.\n\n        However, note: we are building a binary tree. Each internal node has two children.\n\n   We need to store the tree for later use (Newick, dendrogram, clustering).\n\n   We\'ll create a class for the tree node:\n\n        class Node:\n            def __init__(self, id, similarity=None, left=None, right=None, leaves=None):\n                self.id = id   # an integer id for the node (for internal use)\n                self.similarity = similarity  # the similarity at which this node was created (only for internal nodes)\n                self.left = left   # left child (a Node or a leaf which is a string)\n                self.right = right # right child\n                self.leaves = leaves # the set of leaf species in this subtree (for clustering)\n\n        Leaves will be represented by strings (the species name) and internal nodes by Node objects.\n\n   Steps for building the tree:\n\n        Start: each leaf is a cluster. We assign an id for each leaf? and we can represent the leaf as a Node with id, and leaves={species}, and left/right None.\n\n        We maintain:\n            clusters: a dictionary mapping cluster id to the Node object for that cluster.\n            current_similarities: a dictionary that maps (id1, id2) to the similarity between them (for clusters that are currently active)\n            heap: a max heap of (similarity, id1, id2) with id1 < id2.\n\n        For the initial clusters ('} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 3937, 'total_tokens': 8033, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 2496}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 2496, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 1441}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': 'cff58900-218f-4c3b-a178-7e5efb322683', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--fcff9784-4ab8-44dd-8eca-b76bd6c3dc0a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 3937, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8033, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 2496}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to implement a hierarchical clustering algorithm (agglomerative) using single linkage with similarity scores (higher is better).\n Steps:\n 1. Start with each species as a separate cluster.\n 2. At each step, find the two clusters (or species) that have the highest similarity score (Needleman-Wunsch score) and merge them.\n 3. When merging, we create a new internal node that will be the parent of the two clusters being merged. The height of this node is the similarity score of the two clusters being merged.\n 4. The similarity between the new cluster and other clusters is defined as the maximum similarity between any member of the new cluster and any member of the other cluster (single linkage).\n\n However, note: We are using similarity (higher is better) and most libraries use distance (lower is better). Therefore, we can convert our similarity scores to distances by:\n    distance = max_similarity - similarity\n but note: the problem states that we must use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores for the tree because later steps will use the raw scores for thresholds.\n\n Important: We are building a tree where the height of each internal node is the similarity score at which the two clusters were merged.\n\n Since the requirement is to have the tree for later tasks (dendrogram and Newick format) and also for cluster extraction by threshold, we need to design the tree structure appropriately.\n\n We can represent the tree as a binary tree with nodes that have:\n   - left and right children (for the two clusters that were merged)\n   - a label (for leaf nodes, the species name; for internal nodes, we can generate a label like "NodeX" or just leave it without a label? But for Newick, we don\'t necessarily need labels for internal nodes)\n   - the height (the similarity score at which this node was created)\n\n We also need to record the cluster members (the set of species in the cluster) for the purpose of computing the similarity between clusters (single linkage).\n\n However, note: the similarity between two clusters is defined as the maximum similarity between any two species in the two clusters. But we have only precomputed the similarity between pairs of original species. We do not have similarities for clusters. Therefore, we can use the precomputed scores for the original species and for clusters we can compute the similarity as:\n     sim(Cluster1, Cluster2) = max{ sim(s1, s2) for s1 in Cluster1 and s2 in Cluster2 }\n\n But note: the problem says we have stored the pairwise scores in a dictionary (from the previous task). So we can use that dictionary.\n\n However, the number of pairs is O(n^2) and we are going to do O(n) merges, and at each merge we need to compute the similarity between the new cluster and every other cluster. The naive way would be O(n^3). We need to be efficient.\n\n Alternative: we can maintain a distance matrix (but we are using similarity) and update it after each merge. The update for single linkage (which uses maximum similarity) is:\n     sim(new_cluster, other_cluster) = max( sim(cluster1, other_cluster), sim(cluster2, other_cluster) )\n\n But note: we are using the maximum similarity (which is the same as the single linkage when converted to distance: because we want the closest in terms of distance, but here we want the most similar). So for similarity, single linkage is the maximum similarity between any pair.\n\n Therefore, we can maintain a similarity matrix between clusters. Initially, the clusters are the individual species and we have the pairwise scores. Then, when we merge two clusters (i and j) to form a new cluster, we can compute the similarity between the new cluster and any other cluster k as:\n     sim(new, k) = max(sim(i, k), sim(j, k))\n\n However, note: we have stored the pairwise scores for the original species in a dictionary. But when we form a new cluster, we don\'t have the similarity between the new cluster and k precomputed? Actually, we can precompute the entire matrix for the original species and then update the matrix for the clusters as we merge.\n\n Steps for the algorithm:\n\n 1. Precompute the similarity matrix for the original species (using the precomputed scores from the previous task). We have a dictionary that maps pair keys (e.g., "Horse_Dog") to the score. We can create a 2D matrix or a dictionary of dictionaries for clusters? But we are going to merge and update.\n\n 2. We maintain:\n      - a list of current clusters (each cluster is a set of species, or we can use an object that holds the species set and a node for the tree)\n      - a similarity matrix (or a dictionary) between clusters. But we can use a heap to quickly find the maximum similarity.\n\n However, because we are going to update the similarities, we need an efficient way. We can use a priority queue for the pairs of clusters? But note: when we merge, we remove two clusters and add one, and then update the similarities of the new cluster with every other cluster.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   clusters = list of initial clusters (each cluster is a leaf node, and we can represent a cluster by an object that has: id, species_set, tree_node)\n\n   We need a data structure to store the similarity between clusters. We can use a dictionary: sim[cluster_id_i][cluster_id_j] = score\n\n   But we also want to quickly find the pair (i, j) with the highest similarity. We can use a max-heap (priority queue). The heap will store tuples: (-score, i, j) because heapq in Python is a min-heap. Or we can use negative to simulate max-heap? Or we can use a max-heap library? Alternatively, we can use a list and each time we update we add new entries and mark old ones as invalid? This might lead to O(n^2 log n) which is acceptable for small n (hundreds of species) but not for thousands.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a matrix that we update and then search for the maximum in the matrix? That would be O(n^2) per merge, which leads to O(n^3) overall. For n=100, that would be 1e6 operations, which is acceptable. For n=1000, it would be 1e9, which is too slow.\n\n   Therefore, we need a better way. We can use a priority queue that we update. However, the standard heapq doesn\'t support updates. Instead, we can use a lazy approach: we have a heap that stores (score, i, j) and we also maintain a matrix of current similarities. When we merge two clusters, we remove all pairs that involve either i or j and then add new pairs for the new cluster with every other cluster. We can use a separate data structure to mark invalid pairs.\n\n   Steps for the heap method:\n\n      Let\'s maintain:\n        - clusters: list of clusters (each cluster has an id and a set of species, and a node for the tree)\n        - sim_matrix: a 2D array (or dictionary of dictionaries) for the similarity between clusters by index? But we are going to remove and add, so we need to index by cluster id? We can use a dictionary: sim[(i, j)] = score, but note that (i,j) is unordered and we want to avoid duplicates.\n\n      We can maintain a heap and a mapping from cluster pairs to the current similarity. Also, we need to mark pairs that are no longer valid.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a heap that we rebuild partially? Actually, after a merge, we remove all pairs that involve the two merged clusters and then add new pairs for the new cluster with every other cluster.\n\n      We\'ll have:\n          heap: a min-heap (or max-heap using negative) of (-score, i, j) for i < j, and we also maintain a dictionary that maps (i,j) to the current score.\n\n      Steps for each merge:\n          pop the heap until we get a valid pair (i.e., the score in the heap matches the current score for (i,j) and both clusters i and j still exist) -> this is the pair with the highest similarity (because we are using negative).\n\n          merge clusters i and j into a new cluster k.\n\n          remove all pairs that involve i or j from the heap? Actually, we can\'t remove arbitrary elements from a heap. Instead, we can mark them as invalid and then skip them when we pop. We\'ll maintain an auxiliary data structure (like a set) of pairs that are invalid? Or we can just leave the old pairs in the heap and ignore them when we see them (if the clusters are still active? but we don\'t have a flag for active clusters).\n\n      Alternatively, we can avoid the heap and at each step scan the entire similarity matrix for the maximum. Given that the number of species is not huge (maybe hundreds) we can do O(n^2) per step and total O(n^3). This is acceptable for n up to a few hundred.\n\n      We\'ll choose the naive method for simplicity because the project does not specify the scale.\n\n 3. For the tree structure:\n\n      We\'ll create a node class:\n\n        class TreeNode:\n            def __init__(self, label=None, height=0, left=None, right=None):\n                self.label = label   # for leaves, the species name; for internal nodes, we can leave as None or assign a unique id\n                self.height = height # the similarity score at which this node was created (for the internal node, for leaf we set to 0? or not used? Actually, leaves are at height 0? But note: the height in the tree for an internal node is the similarity score of the alignment that created it. Leaves don\'t have a height in the same way, but for the dendrogram we will set the leaf height to 0? Actually, in the dendrogram, the leaves are at the bottom (height 0) and the internal nodes are at the height of their similarity.\n\n        However, note: the similarity score for a leaf? It doesn\'t have one. So when we create a leaf node, we set height=0.\n\n        Then when we merge two nodes (say node1 and node2) with similarity score s, we create a new internal node with:\n            left = node1\n            right = node2\n            height = s\n\n        The root node will be the last node created.\n\n 4. Steps:\n\n        Initialize:\n            clusters = [ TreeNode(label=species, height=0) for each species ]\n            active = set(range(n))   # indices of clusters that are still active\n            sim_matrix = 2D list of size n x n, initialized with the pairwise scores for the original species.\n\n            Note: for two different species, we have the score. For the same species, we don\'t need because we won\'t merge a cluster with itself. Also, we only need the upper triangle.\n\n        We also need to store the current similarity between clusters. Initially, the similarity between cluster i and j (i != j) is the precomputed score for the two species.\n\n        Then, while there is more than one cluster:\n\n            Find the pair (i, j) with i != j and i,j in active that has the maximum similarity.\n\n            Create a new node:\n                new_node = TreeNode(height=sim_matrix[i][j], left=clusters[i], right=clusters[j])\n\n            Remove i and j from active and add a new cluster (with index, say, k = next available index) to clusters.\n\n            Update the similarity matrix:\n                For every other active cluster l:\n                    sim_matrix[k][l] = max(sim_matrix[i][l], sim_matrix[j][l])\n                    sim_matrix[l][k] = sim_matrix[k][l]   (if symmetric)\n\n            Also, set sim_matrix[k][k] = 0 (or not needed)\n\n            We also need to remove rows and columns for i and j? Instead, we can mark i and j as inactive and then we only consider active clusters.\n\n        The last node will be the root.\n\n 5. However, note: the similarity matrix is for the original species. But when we form a new cluster, the similarity between the new cluster and an old cluster is the maximum of the similarities of the two original clusters that formed the new cluster? Actually, it\'s the maximum similarity between any species in the new cluster and the old cluster. Since we are doing single linkage, and we have the pairwise scores only for the original species, we can compute it as the maximum of the similarities between any species in the new cluster and any species in the old cluster. But we don\'t have the entire set? Actually, we can precompute the entire matrix for the original species and then update by taking the maximum of the two clusters that were merged? But note: we are updating the matrix for the new cluster with every other cluster. And we are using the precomputed pairwise scores for the original species. However, for a cluster that is not a leaf, we don\'t have a representative sequence? We only have the tree node. But we don\'t need the sequence for the cluster, only the precomputed scores for the original species.\n\n        So: the similarity between a new cluster (which is the union of two clusters, say A and B) and another cluster C is:\n            max{ sim(a, c) for a in A and c in C }\n\n        But note: we have stored the pairwise scores only for the original species. Therefore, we can precompute a matrix for the original species and then for clusters, we can compute the similarity by:\n            sim(A, C) = max{ sim(a, c) for a in A, c in C }\n\n        However, we don\'t want to iterate over all pairs of species in the two clusters at every step (that would be O(|A|*|C|)). We can avoid this by storing for each cluster the set of original species it contains. Then we can store a data structure that for each cluster C, we store the maximum similarity between any species in C and a fixed original species? Actually, we don\'t need that. Instead, we can precompute a matrix M where M[i][j] is the similarity between the i-th original species and the j-th original species. Then for two clusters A and B (each is a set of original species), we can compute:\n            sim(A, B) = max{ M[a][b] for a in A, b in B }\n\n        But doing that for every pair of clusters at every step would be too expensive.\n\n        Alternatively, we can maintain for each cluster the set of original species. Then, when we form a new cluster, we can store the union of the sets. Then to compute the similarity between two clusters, we can do:\n\n            sim(cluster1, cluster2) = max( M[i][j] for i in cluster1.original_species, j in cluster2.original_species )\n\n        But then the update for one cluster pair would be O(|cluster1| * |cluster2|). And we have to do this for every other cluster? Then the total time per merge would be O(n * |cluster1| * |cluster2|). That is too expensive.\n\n        Therefore, we need a more efficient way.\n\n        We can precompute the entire matrix for the original species and then update the similarity between the new cluster and an existing cluster by:\n\n            sim(new_cluster, existing_cluster) = max( sim(cluster1, existing_cluster), sim(cluster2, existing_cluster) )\n\n        But wait: is that correct? \n\n            sim(new_cluster, existing_cluster) = max_{x in new_cluster, y in existing_cluster} M[x][y]\n                                           = max( max_{x in cluster1, y in existing_cluster} M[x][y], max_{x in cluster2, y in existing_cluster} M[x][y] )\n                                           = max( sim(cluster1, existing_cluster), sim(cluster2, existing_cluster) )\n\n        So yes, we can update in O(1) per existing cluster if we have stored the similarities between the existing clusters and the two clusters being merged.\n\n        Therefore, we can maintain a 2D array (or a dictionary) for the current similarities between clusters (by cluster index). Initially, for cluster i (which contains one species) and cluster j (one species), the similarity is M[i][j] (the precomputed score for the two species). Then when we form a new cluster k from clusters i and j, we compute for every other cluster l:\n\n            sim(k, l) = max( sim(i, l), sim(j, l) )\n\n        This is O(n) per merge.\n\n        So the entire algorithm is O(n^2) because we do n-1 merges and each merge we do O(n) work.\n\n 6. Implementation of the similarity matrix:\n\n        Let n0 = initial number of species.\n\n        We create a matrix `sim` of size (2*n0 - 1) x (2*n0 - 1) because we will create n0-1 internal nodes. But we don\'t need to allocate a big matrix, we can use a list of current similarities for active clusters? Actually, we can maintain:\n\n            current_sim: a dictionary of dictionaries? But we can use a list of current active clusters and a list of similarities between them.\n\n        Alternatively, we can maintain a 1D array for the current similarities of each active cluster with every other active cluster? Actually, we can maintain a 2D matrix that we update by removing rows for i and j and adding a new row for k? But we are going to have a fixed size? No, the number of clusters decreases by one at every step.\n\n        We\'ll maintain:\n\n            clusters: list of cluster objects. Initially, each cluster is:\n                { id: index, species_set: set of original species indices, node: the TreeNode object }\n\n            But note: we need to compute the similarity between two clusters by their indices? We can have a matrix that we update? But the matrix size is decreasing? Actually, we can have a full matrix for the active clusters. The maximum number of active clusters is n0, and we start with n0 and then decrease by one at each merge.\n\n            We can have:\n\n                active_indices: list of current active cluster indices.\n\n                sim_matrix: a 2D array where the indices are the current active indices? But the active indices change.\n\n            Instead, we can store the current similarities in a dictionary: sim[(i, j)] for i<j, and we update.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Initialize:\n                clusters = [ cluster0, cluster1, ... cluster_{n0-1} ]   # each cluster i has a set {i} and a tree node (leaf) for species i.\n                active = set(range(n0))\n\n                # Precomputed similarity for original species: we have a dictionary from the previous task: keys are "species1_species2", but we have the species names. We need to map the species name to an index? Or we can use the species name in the cluster set? But then we need to index the species.\n\n                We can create a list of species names in a fixed order: species_list = sorted(organisms.keys())\n                Then the original cluster for species_list[i] will be index i.\n\n'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4236, 'total_tokens': 8332, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 3904}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 3904, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 332}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '2ad43d5a-2b8e-456a-a134-3a6c942b7cf1', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--7f80bb18-8c06-41b5-b1e1-17f22a6f9b94-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4236, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8332, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 3904}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to extend the project to build a phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering (agglomerative with single linkage, but using similarity instead of distance) and then save the tree in Newick format.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have the pairwise similarity scores from the previous task (stored in a dictionary with keys like "species1_species2").\n 2. We need to convert these similarity scores into a distance matrix for clustering? Actually, note: the clustering algorithm in `scipy` uses distances (dissimilarities). Since we have similarities, we can convert to distances by:\n    distance = (max_similarity - similarity) or (max_similarity - similarity + 1) to avoid zero? But note: the requirement says to use the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores for the tree building and that the tree nodes should have the similarity score as height.\n\n However, the problem states: "we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar)". This is equivalent to using the similarity as the linkage criterion. But note: in agglomerative clustering, we usually use a distance (minimal distance to merge). So we have two options:\n\n Option 1: Convert similarity to distance. For example, distance = max_score - similarity. Then we do clustering with the distance matrix. Then the height of the node in the dendrogram would be the distance? But the requirement says the intermediate node should have the similarity score as its height.\n\n Option 2: Use a custom hierarchical clustering that works directly on similarities (and merges the pair with the highest similarity). Then the height of the node would be the similarity score.\n\n We are going to do Option 2 because the requirement is clear: the intermediate node should have the Needleman-Wunsch score (the similarity) as its height.\n\n However, note: the standard libraries (like `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`) work on distances. Therefore, we have two choices:\n   a) Convert the similarity to a distance and then adjust the linkage matrix so that the heights (which are normally distances) are converted back to similarities? But this might be messy because the linkage algorithm uses distances and then the heights are computed as the distance at which clusters merge. We want the height to be the similarity at which they merge.\n\n   b) Implement a custom hierarchical clustering algorithm that uses similarity.\n\n Considering the requirement for later tasks (dendrogram drawing and Newick format) and that we are to use the raw scores for the tree, I propose:\n\n We will implement a custom hierarchical clustering algorithm that uses similarity. We\'ll build a binary tree (dendrogram) where each node has:\n   - left and right children (if internal node)\n   - the similarity score (height) at which they merged\n   - the list of leaves (or just the leaf name if leaf) and the total number of leaves (for ordering in Newick?).\n\n But note: the requirement for the Newick format. The Newick format with distances requires branch lengths. The problem says: "distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number". However, note that the example in the instruction for the Newick format with distances uses branch lengths. How do we define the branch length?\n\n In the tree building step, we are told that the intermediate node gets the similarity score as its height. But the branch length in a phylogenetic tree is usually the difference in heights (or time) between the node and its parent.\n\n However, in the description, we are building the tree from the bottom up. The leaves are at height 0? Actually, no. The leaves are individual species and we don\'t have a similarity score for a single species. The similarity score is only for pairs.\n\n We need to define the height for the leaves? The problem does not specify. But note: in the intermediate node, the height is the similarity score of the two merged species (or clusters). So the leaf nodes are not assigned a height? Then how do we assign branch lengths?\n\n Let\'s think about the example: \n   We have two species A and B with similarity 10. Then we create an internal node AB with height=10. \n   Then if we merge AB with C at similarity 5, then the new node ABC has height=5.\n\n Now, the branch from A to AB: \n   The difference in height between AB and A is 10 - (what?)? We don\'t have a height for A.\n\n Standard practice in UPGMA (which uses average linkage and assumes a molecular clock) is to set the leaf at height 0. Then the branch length from A to AB is (height of AB - height of A) = 10 - 0 = 10? But that would be the entire height. However, note that in UPGMA, the branch length from A to AB is (height of AB - height of A) but since A was at 0, it\'s 10. Then when we merge AB with C at height 5, the branch from AB to ABC is (5 - 10) = -5? That doesn\'t make sense.\n\n Actually, we are building the tree by merging the most similar first (so the highest similarity first) and then the next. But note: the similarity is decreasing as we go up? Because we are merging less similar clusters. So the root will have the smallest similarity.\n\n How to assign branch lengths?\n\n We can define the height of a leaf as 0. Then the branch length from a leaf to its parent (the first internal node) is the height of the parent (the similarity score of the merge) minus 0.\n\n Then when we have an internal node that is merged again at a lower similarity (say s), then the branch length from that internal node to the new parent is (s - original similarity of the internal node).\n\n Example:\n   Merge A and B at similarity 10: \n        Node AB: height = 10\n        Branch A->AB: 10 - 0 = 10\n        Branch B->AB: 10 - 0 = 10\n\n   Then merge AB with C at similarity 5:\n        Node ABC: height = 5\n        Branch AB->ABC: 5 - 10 = -5 -> negative? Not acceptable.\n\n So we see that if we use the similarity as the height and then subtract to get branch lengths, we get negative branches because the similarity decreases as we go up.\n\n Therefore, we must reconsider.\n\n The problem says: the intermediate node should have the similarity score as its height. But in a dendrogram, the height of the node is the similarity at which the merge occurs. Then the branch length from a node to its parent is the difference between the parent\'s height and the child\'s height? But the parent is above (so lower similarity) and the child is below (higher similarity). So:\n\n   Branch length from A to AB: (height of AB) - (height of A) = 10 - 0 = 10.\n   Branch length from AB to ABC: (height of ABC) - (height of AB) = 5 - 10 = -5 -> negative.\n\n This is a problem.\n\n Alternative interpretation: The branch length is the time or evolutionary distance, which should be positive. How do we convert similarity to evolutionary distance? \n\n In fact, the Needleman-Wunsch score is not a direct measure of time. But the requirement is to use the raw score for the tree. \n\n We have two options for the Newick format with distances:\n\n 1. Use the absolute similarity score for the branch? But then the entire tree would have the same branch length for every leaf? Not meaningful.\n\n 2. Instead, we store the node heights as the similarity, and then when writing the Newick with distances, we do not use the branch lengths but the cumulative "depth" from the root? That doesn\'t match the example.\n\n 3. Or, we define the branch length as the difference in similarity between the child and the parent? But as we saw, that can be negative.\n\n Since the problem states: "the distances shouldn\'t include any decimal point number", and the example is "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);", we must assign a positive integer to each branch.\n\n How about we invert the similarity to make it a distance? Then the branch length would be the difference in the inverted values? \n\n Let D = max_similarity - similarity (for a given pair). Then the clustering would be done on distances (so we can use standard methods). Then the height of a node would be the distance at which clusters merge? But the requirement says the node must have the similarity score as height.\n\n We are in a bind.\n\n Let me re-read the requirement: "the tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor. ... the intermediate node should have a height of 1200".\n\n And for the Newick format with distances: we are to write branch lengths as integers.\n\n How do we assign branch lengths?\n\n I think the requirement for the intermediate node having the similarity as height is for the dendrogram. In the dendrogram, the vertical bar for a node is drawn at that similarity. The horizontal lines (branches) don\'t have a numerical value in the same way. The Newick format with distances requires a branch length for each branch.\n\n The problem does not specify how to compute the branch lengths. But note that the example for the Newick format with distances does not use the height of the node but the branch length from the node to its parent.\n\n We need to define:\n\n   For a leaf node: \n        branch_length = (similarity of the parent node) - (0)   [if we assume leaves are at 0]? \n\n   For an internal node (say with children A and B, and the node has similarity s, and then this node is merged with another node at similarity s_parent):\n        branch_length = s_parent - s   [if s_parent is the similarity of the parent node]? But then if we merge at a lower similarity, we get a negative.\n\n So we must use a transformation.\n\n Approach:\n\n   We are building the tree bottom-up. The leaves are at time t=0. The similarity score is a measure of how close two sequences are. We can convert similarity to a distance by:\n\n        distance = max_similarity - similarity\n\n   Then the distance is non-negative and increases as sequences are less similar.\n\n   Then the height of the internal node (in the dendrogram) would be the distance (max_similarity - similarity) at which the merge occurs? But the requirement says the node should have the similarity score as height.\n\n   However, the dendrogram can be plotted with the similarity on the y-axis? That is, the y-axis is similarity (so high similarity at the bottom). Then the branch length in the Newick tree (which is for the horizontal axis) is arbitrary? Actually, the Newick branch length is used for the horizontal axis in a rectangular dendrogram? Or for a phylogram?\n\n   We are going to generate two Newick formats:\n\n        Format 1: only leaf names -> no branch lengths, just topology.\n        Format 2: with branch lengths.\n\n   The requirement for the second format: we must provide branch lengths as integers.\n\n   How to assign branch lengths?\n\n   We can define the branch length for a node (from the node to its parent) as the difference between the parent\'s similarity and the child\'s similarity? But again, that would be negative.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define the branch length as the difference between the child\'s similarity and the parent\'s similarity? Then:\n\n        branch_length = (child_similarity - parent_similarity)\n\n   This would be positive because the child\'s similarity is higher than the parent\'s.\n\n   Example:\n\n        A and B merge at similarity 10 -> node AB.\n        Then AB and C merge at similarity 5.\n\n        For A and B: \n            branch_length from A to AB: (0 - 10) = -10? -> no.\n\n        We need to think of the branch as the amount of evolution from the node to the parent. The evolution is from the common ancestor (the node) to the next common ancestor (the parent). The time? We don\'t have time.\n\n   Another idea: the branch length is the amount of change (in terms of the scoring) that occurred on that branch. But we don\'t have that.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I propose:\n\n        We store the tree with the similarity at each internal node. Then when writing the Newick with branch lengths, we will compute the branch length for a child node (whether leaf or internal) as:\n\n            branch_length = (parent_node_similarity - child_node_similarity)   [but this is negative] -> absolute value? \n\n        But note: the parent_node_similarity is always less than or equal to the child_node_similarity? Because we merge from high similarity to low. So:\n\n            branch_length = child_node_similarity - parent_node_similarity\n\n        Then for the leaf: the child_node_similarity is undefined? For a leaf, we can set the child_node_similarity to the maximum similarity that that leaf had with any other leaf? Or we set it to the similarity of the first merge (the one that created its first internal node)? \n\n        Actually, for a leaf, when it is first merged, the branch length from the leaf to the first internal node is:\n\n            branch_length = (similarity of the first internal node) - (some base value)\n\n        What base value? We haven\'t defined the similarity of a leaf.\n\n        We can define the similarity of a leaf as the maximum similarity that leaf has with any other leaf? But that is arbitrary.\n\n        Alternatively, we can define the entire tree such that the branch length for a leaf to its parent is the similarity of the parent node (because the leaf is at 0). Then:\n\n            leaf_branch_length = parent_similarity\n\n        and for an internal node, the branch length to its parent is:\n\n            branch_length = parent_similarity - current_node_similarity\n\n        Then in the example:\n\n            A and B merge at 10: \n                A: branch_length = 10\n                B: branch_length = 10\n                AB node has similarity 10.\n\n            Then AB and C merge at 5:\n                AB: branch_length = 5 - 10 = -5 -> negative.\n\n        We cannot have negative.\n\n   Given the complexity, I think we should clarify the requirement. However, since we are not allowed to, we must make a decision.\n\n   Standard practice in UPGMA (which is a hierarchical clustering method that assumes constant rate of evolution) is to set:\n\n        The height of a leaf = 0.\n        The height of an internal node = (the distance from the node to the leaves) [which is the average of the distances of the leaves in the cluster].\n\n        Then the branch length from a node to its parent = (height of the parent - height of the child)\n\n   But note: we are working with similarity, not distance. We can convert similarity to distance by: distance = max_score - similarity.\n\n   Then we can run UPGMA on the distance matrix. Then the height of the internal node in the UPGMA tree is the distance from the node to the leaves. Then the branch lengths are positive.\n\n   And then when we write the Newick with distances, we use the branch lengths as the differences in height.\n\n   But the requirement says: the intermediate node should have the similarity score as its height. \n\n   We can do:\n\n        We\'ll build the tree using the distance matrix (max_similarity - similarity) with UPGMA (which is available in `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` as method=\'average\').\n\n        Then the height of the internal node in the dendrogram is the distance (max_similarity - s), so the original similarity s = max_similarity - height.\n\n        Then we want the node to be labeled with s? But the requirement is for the node to have the similarity as its height? \n\n        Actually, the requirement does not say that the node must be stored with the similarity as height in the tree data structure? It says "the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200", meaning that in the dendrogram the node is drawn at y=1200 (similarity). So we can:\n\n            - Use the distance matrix for clustering (using UPGMA) to get the linkage matrix.\n            - Then when we build the Newick tree, we convert the distance-based heights back to similarities: \n                    similarity = max_similarity - distance_height\n\n            - Then the branch length in the Newick tree (which is the horizontal part) would be the difference in the distance? But the Newick branch length is the distance (in the evolutionary sense). We want to output the branch length as the distance (max_similarity - similarity) difference? \n\n        This is getting complicated.\n\n   Given the time, I propose we do:\n\n        Step 1: Convert the similarity matrix to a distance matrix: \n                  D[i,j] = max_score - S[i,j]\n                where max_score is the maximum similarity score in the entire matrix? Or the theoretical maximum? We can use the maximum value in the matrix.\n\n        Step 2: Perform UPGMA clustering on D.\n\n        Step 3: The resulting linkage matrix has distances (which we call distance_height). We want the node\'s similarity = max_score - distance_height.\n\n        Step 4: Now, to write the Newick tree with branch lengths that are integers and positive, we note that the UPGMA tree has the property that the branch length from a node to its parent is (parent_distance_height - current_distance_height). This branch length is positive.\n\n        But the requirement for the Newick format with distances is to have branch lengths. We can output the UPGMA branch lengths (which are in the distance space) as integers? \n\n        However, the problem says: the branch lengths should be integers. They will be if we convert the floats to integers? But we are using integers for the scores.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the branch length in the distance space? That is, the horizontal axis would be the distance (not the similarity). This might be acceptable because the branch length is the evolutionary distance.\n\n        But the requirement says: "the tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor" and the intermediate node should have the similarity score as its height. \n\n        We are storing the tree with the distance-based heights. We can also store the similarity at each node for later use (like when drawing the dendrogram we can use the similarity for the y-axis).\n\n        However, for the Newick format with distances, we are only asked to output the branch lengths (which are in the distance space) and the leaf names.\n\n        So for the second Newick format: we output the UPGMA tree with branch lengths in the distance space.\n\n        For the first Newick format (without branch lengths) we just output the topology.\n\n        But note: the requirement for the intermediate step of building the tree says: the intermediate node should have the similarity score as its height. We are not storing the tree in the program with the similarity as the height? We are storing it with the distance. We can create a custom tree structure that also holds the similarity at each node.\n\n        How about we build a tree structure from the linkage matrix that also holds the similarity at each internal node? Then we can use that for the dendrogram drawing and for the Newick without branch lengths we don\'t need the branch'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4481, 'total_tokens': 8577, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 4224}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 4224, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 257}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '402cbe90-9ac9-4e36-b053-4594f580d106', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--55e44a59-bfff-4d99-b6da-d41b6d84517e-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4481, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8577, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 4224}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to use the `scipy` library for hierarchical clustering because it provides a way to perform agglomerative clustering and also to generate dendrograms and Newick format trees. However, note that the standard linkage function in scipy operates on a distance matrix, but we have a similarity matrix. Therefore, we will convert the similarity to distance appropriately.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We have a dictionary of pairwise Needleman-Wunsch scores (similarity) for each pair of species.\n 2. We need to form a condensed distance matrix (upper triangle) for the linkage function. Since higher similarity means closer, we can convert similarity to distance by:\n      distance = max_similarity - similarity\n    But note: the maximum similarity might not be the same for all pairs. Alternatively, we can use:\n      distance = (max_possible_score) - similarity\n    However, we don\'t know the max_possible_score. Another way is to use the maximum observed similarity in the matrix as the reference? But that might not be the absolute maximum.\n\n 3. Alternatively, we can invert the similarity by taking negative: \n      distance = -similarity\n    Then the most similar (highest positive similarity) becomes the smallest distance (most negative). But then the distances become negative which is not acceptable for linkage.\n\n 4. Since the linkage algorithm requires non-negative distances, we can do:\n      distance = max_similarity_observed - similarity\n    This will make the most similar pair have distance 0 and others positive. However, note that the tree heights will then be in terms of this transformed distance.\n\n 5. But the requirement says: the intermediate node for a merge of two species should have a height equal to the Needleman-Wunsch score (the raw similarity). So when we plot, we want the x-axis (or the branch lengths) to represent the raw similarity? \n\n However, note that the dendrogram in scipy is built from the linkage matrix which uses distances. We have to be cautious.\n\n Approach:\n\n We have two options:\n\n Option A: \n   - Build the linkage matrix using a distance matrix computed as: distance = max_similarity - similarity, where max_similarity is the maximum value in the similarity matrix. Then the height of the node in the linkage matrix (the distance at which clusters are merged) will be: max_similarity - similarity_value_of_that_merge.\n\n   - But then when we plot, we can relabel the x-axis (which is distance) to show similarity? Or we can flip the axis? Actually, we want the dendrogram to show the similarity as the measure of closeness. \n\n Option B:\n   - Instead, we can use the raw similarity as the "distance" but then we have to invert the merging order. The linkage method expects that smaller distances mean closer. But our similarity: higher means closer. So we can set the distance as: \n        D = (max_similarity - similarity)   [so that higher similarity becomes smaller distance]\n\n   - Then when we build the dendrogram, the y-axis will be the distance (max_similarity - similarity). But we want the y-axis to be the similarity? \n\n  The instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". Actually, in a dendrogram, the vertical axis (for a horizontal dendrogram) is the similarity (or distance) at which merges occur. So we want the vertical axis to represent the raw Needleman-Wunsch score (similarity) for the merge.\n\n How can we achieve that?\n\n  We can:\n   - Use a distance matrix: D = max_similarity - S, where S is the similarity matrix.\n   - Then the linkage matrix will have the third column (the distance between the merged clusters) as: d = max_similarity - s, where s is the similarity at which they merged.\n   - Then when we plot the dendrogram, we can change the labels of the vertical axis to: max_similarity - d. But that would recover s.\n\n  Alternatively, we can leave the linkage matrix as is (with the distance) and then adjust the dendrogram plotting by setting the `label_func` for the y-axis? But that might be messy.\n\n  Actually, we can set the `orientation` to \'left\' so that the dendrogram is horizontal and the vertical axis becomes the similarity? But note the instruction: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". \n\n  Let me clarify: \n      - In a horizontal dendrogram, the leaves are on the left and the branches extend to the right. The horizontal position of a node (the branch) should be determined by the Needleman-Wunsch score (similarity) for that merge.\n\n  How about we do:\n      - We use the distance matrix: D = max_similarity - S\n      - Then we build the linkage matrix (with method=\'single\')? But note: the problem says single linkage. However, we are building a phylogenetic tree and the standard method for this is UPGMA (which is average linkage and assumes ultrametric). But the instruction says: "merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score", which is exactly the single linkage (or complete? actually, single linkage for distance is the minimum distance, which corresponds to maximum similarity). So we use method=\'single\'? \n\n  But note: the instruction says "single linkage methodology". So we use method=\'single\'.\n\n  Then, when we plot the dendrogram, we can set the orientation to \'left\' and the horizontal axis (which is the x-axis) will be the distance (max_similarity - similarity). But we want the x-axis to be the similarity. \n\n  So we can flip the axis? We can set the x-axis to be: max_similarity - (the distance value). But how?\n\n  Alternatively, we can create a custom dendrogram by modifying the plot? But that is complex.\n\n  Another idea: \n      Instead of using the distance matrix, we can use the similarity matrix as if it were a distance matrix but then we use the maximum similarity to set the threshold? \n\n  Actually, the `dendrogram` function in scipy doesn\'t allow to invert the axis. \n\n  So we do:\n      - We build the linkage with D = max_similarity - S\n      - Then we plot the dendrogram with `orientation=\'left\'` and then we change the x-axis ticks to show the similarity? We can compute the similarity for each tick as: similarity = max_similarity - distance\n\n  However, the dendrogram function doesn\'t let us change the axis values arbitrarily. We can post-process the plot:\n\n      - We get the current x-axis ticks and labels, then set the labels to: [str(max_similarity - float(tick)) for tick in ticks]\n\n  But note: the ticks are the distance values? Actually, the x-axis in a horizontal dendrogram (with orientation=\'left\') is the distance. So we can change the tick labels to show the similarity? However, the positions of the branches are determined by the distance. But we want the positions to be determined by the similarity? \n\n  This is a problem: the dendrogram is drawn with the branch positions at the distance value. But we want the branch positions to be at the similarity value. So we have to draw the dendrogram at the similarity values? \n\n  How about we create the linkage matrix but then we change the distance values in the linkage matrix to be the similarity? That would break the hierarchical structure because the linkage matrix must be built on distances (with increasing order). \n\n  Alternatively, we can build the linkage matrix with the distance (max_similarity - S) and then when we have the dendrogram, we can change the coordinates of the lines to be in terms of similarity? \n\n  This is complex. Instead, we can use the `to_tree` method of the linkage matrix to get a tree structure and then traverse the tree to build a custom dendrogram? But that is a lot of work.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since we also need to output Newick format, we might consider building our own tree structure? But the instruction says we can choose libraries.\n\n  Another library: `biopython` has a Phylo module that can handle trees and also draw dendrograms? But it doesn\'t have built-in hierarchical clustering.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the `ete3` library which is designed for phylogenetic trees. It has built-in functions for clustering and also for drawing. But we are trying to avoid too many dependencies? \n\n  However, the user said: "You can choose necessary libraries freely". So let\'s use `ete3` because it is designed for this.\n\n  Steps with ete3:\n    - We can build a tree from the distance matrix (which we compute as max_similarity - S) using the UPGMA or single linkage method? \n    - ete3 has a `ClusterTree` class that can build trees from distance matrices.\n\n  But note: the instruction says single linkage. \n\n  How to build a tree with ete3:\n\n      from ete3 import ClusterTree\n      # We have a list of species names and a distance matrix (or a lower triangular vector)\n      # But note: we have a full matrix? We can convert to condensed form.\n\n      tree = ClusterTree(upgma_tree, leaf_names=names)   # but this is for UPGMA\n\n  Actually, ete3 supports different linkage methods? The documentation says: \n      "linkage: linkage method. It can be ‚Äòsingle‚Äô, ‚Äòcomplete‚Äô, ‚Äòaverage‚Äô, ‚Äòweighted‚Äô, or ‚Äòcentroid‚Äô."\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      tree = ClusterTree.from_linkage_matrix(linkage_matrix, leaf_names)\n\n  But then we have to compute the linkage matrix? We can compute it with scipy and then use ete3 to build the tree? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` to build the linkage matrix and then convert it to an ete3 tree? \n\n  Actually, ete3 has a function to build a tree from a linkage matrix: `Tree.from_linkage_matrix(linkage_matrix, id_list)`\n\n  Then we can use ete3 to:\n      - output Newick format (with branch lengths or without)\n      - draw the dendrogram\n\n  And ete3 allows to set the branch lengths to the similarity? \n\n  However, note: the linkage matrix we built (using scipy) has the distance (max_similarity - similarity) as the merge distance. Then the tree built from that linkage matrix will have the branch lengths in terms of distance. But we want the branch lengths (the height of the nodes) to be the similarity? \n\n  How about we build the tree and then traverse it and change the branch lengths? We can set the branch length for each node to be the similarity? But note: the similarity at the merge is the value we want for the node? \n\n  Actually, the node height should be the similarity. But in the distance-based tree, the height of a node is the distance (from the leaves). We want the height to be the similarity. \n\n  We can set the branch length of the node (from the parent) to be: (similarity of the node - similarity of the parent) ? \n\n  But note: the tree is built from the bottom up. The leaves are at distance 0 (or similarity max_similarity). Then the first merge happens at similarity s1, which corresponds to distance d1 = max_similarity - s1. The next merge at similarity s2 (which is lower than s1) corresponds to distance d2 = max_similarity - s2 (which is greater than d1). \n\n  In the tree, the distance from the leaf to the root is the cumulative distance. But we want the branch to be drawn at the similarity value? \n\n  Actually, in a dendrogram, the vertical position of the node (for a horizontal dendrogram) is the similarity at which the merge occurs. \n\n  With ete3, we can set the node.dist attribute to the distance (from the parent) but we don\'t have a parent? \n\n  Alternatively, we can build the tree and then set the feature "height" for each node to the similarity? Then when we draw, we can use the \'height\' attribute to set the position? \n\n  The ete3 tree drawing can use a custom attribute for branch positions? \n\n  Actually, the `TreeStyle` in ete3 has a `scale` parameter that can be set to the attribute we want? \n\n  But let me look at the documentation: \n      http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial_drawing.html\n\n  We can set the tree layout to show branch lengths? But we want the dendrogram to be drawn with the horizontal axis being the similarity.\n\n  Alternatively, we can build the tree without branch lengths and then set the node positions manually? \n\n  This is getting too complex.\n\n  Given the time, I propose:\n\n  1. We use scipy to compute the linkage matrix (with distance = max_similarity - similarity) and method=\'single\'.\n  2. We use scipy to generate the Newick tree? Actually, scipy has `to_tree` and then we can write a recursive function to output Newick? But we also need to output two formats: with and without branch lengths.\n\n  3. For the dendrogram plot, we use scipy\'s `dendrogram` and then adjust the plot to show similarity on the x-axis? We can:\n        - Create the dendrogram with `orientation=\'left\'` and then change the x-axis labels to show the similarity? But the positions of the branches are at the distance. We want the positions to be at the similarity? \n\n      We can flip the data: \n          We can set the positions of the branches to be at (max_similarity - distance) and then set the x-axis to be from max_similarity down to 0? \n\n      Actually, we can create a custom plot by:\n          - Getting the coordinates of the lines from the dendrogram dictionary and then redrawing with the similarity values.\n\n      How to do that:\n\n          from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram\n          Z = linkage(...)   # our linkage matrix\n          ddata = dendrogram(Z, orientation=\'left\', no_plot=True)\n          # ddata contains the coordinates of the lines? \n\n          Then we can create a new figure and for each line in ddata[\'icoord\'] and ddata[\'dcoord\'] we adjust the coordinates: \n              The dcoord (which is the vertical coordinate for the lines) we leave as is (it\'s the order of the leaves). \n              The icoord (which is the horizontal coordinate) we convert: \n                  new_icoord = max_similarity - icoord   [but note: icoord is in the distance space]\n\n          Then we plot the lines with the new_icoord.\n\n      But then we have to build the dendrogram manually.\n\n  This is a lot of code.\n\n  Considering the complexity and the fact that the user wants a horizontal dendrogram with the x-axis in similarity, and also Newick output, I propose we use the `dendropy` library? Or stick to scipy and adjust the plot.\n\n  But to avoid introducing too many libraries, let\'s stick to scipy for the linkage and then for the dendrogram we do a custom plot? \n\n  Alternatively, we can accept that the dendrogram is plotted with distance (max_similarity - similarity) on the x-axis and then we label it as similarity? But that would be confusing because the numbers would be decreasing? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n      dendrogram(Z, orientation=\'left\', ax=ax)\n      # Now, the x-axis is distance (max_sim - sim). We want to show the similarity on the axis.\n      # We can set the x-axis ticks to the distance values and then change the labels to the corresponding similarity.\n      xticks = ax.get_xticks()\n      ax.set_xticklabels([str(int(max_similarity - x)) for x in xticks])\n\n  Then the positions of the branches are still in distance, but the labels are similarity. The branch for a merge at similarity s will be drawn at position (max_similarity - s) and then labeled as s. This is acceptable? \n\n  However, the instruction says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". This means the position should be at the similarity value? But we are drawing at the distance value and then labeling as similarity. \n\n  This might be acceptable if we clarify in the documentation. But note: the visual distance between branches will be in the distance space, not similarity. \n\n  Given the time constraints and complexity, I will choose this approach.\n\n  Steps summary:\n\n  1. Compute the similarity matrix (from the pairwise scores we already have). We have a dictionary of scores for each pair, but we need a full matrix? Actually, for the condensed distance matrix, we only need the upper triangle in a vector.\n\n  2. Let M be the number of species. We form a condensed distance matrix (of length M*(M-1)//2) where:\n        dist[i, j] = max_similarity - S[i, j]\n\n  3. Compute the linkage matrix with `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` using method=\'single\'.\n\n  4. Build the dendrogram (for plotting) and adjust the x-axis labels.\n\n  5. For Newick tree: \n        We can use `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.to_tree` to get a tree node, and then write a recursive function to output Newick format? Or use `biopython` or `ete3`? \n\n  But the user wants two formats: with and without branch lengths.\n\n  We can write our own tree traversal? \n\n  However, there is a function in scipy: `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.to_tree` returns a tree that we can traverse.\n\n  How to output Newick without branch lengths:\n\n        def to_newick(node, parent_dist, leaf_names, newick=\'\'):\n            if node.is_leaf():\n                return "%s" % leaf_names[node.id]\n            else:\n                if len(newick) > 0:\n                    newick = "(%s,%s)" % (to_newick(node.left, node.dist, leaf_names), to_newick(node.right, node.dist, leaf_names))\n                else:\n                    newick = "(%s,%s)" % (to_newick(node.left, node.dist, leaf_names), to_newick(node.right, node.dist, leaf_names))\n                return newick\n\n        But note: the node.dist is the distance from the node to its children? Actually, the `to_tree` function returns a tree where the distance of a node is the distance from the node to the leaves? \n\n  Actually, the node in the tree from `to_tree` has:\n        - left: left child\n        - right: right child\n        - dist: the distance between the children? Actually, it\'s the height of the node above the leaves? \n\n  We want the branch lengths to be the difference in heights between the node and its parent? But we don\'t have parent. \n\n  Alternatively, we can set the branch length'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4629, 'total_tokens': 8725, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 4416}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 4416, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 213}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '70c99437-8b97-4f83-93b3-bdd51721ef31', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--cd9b3c7f-7deb-41ef-a87d-fcb8fb974336-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4629, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8725, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 4416}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response - content not available, saving full reasoning:**

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are building upon the previous steps. We now have:\n 1. A pairwise similarity score matrix (from Needleman-Wunsch) stored in a dictionary (and also saved in JSON)\n 2. A hierarchical clustering (phylogenetic tree) built using the similarity scores, stored as a tree structure (we used a linkage matrix or a tree object from scipy, but we built our own for control over the heights being the raw scores).\n 3. We have saved the tree in Newick format and drawn a dendrogram.\n\n Now, for the third task:\n - We have a file "thresholds.txt" containing one threshold per line (each is an integer).\n - We need to cut the tree at each threshold and determine the clusters of species (leaf nodes) that are still connected above that threshold.\n\n Important: \n   - The tree was built with internal nodes having a height equal to the similarity score at which they were formed (the Needleman-Wunsch score of the two merged clusters).\n   - Since we are using similarity (higher = more similar) and thresholds are given as similarity scores, we want to consider the tree from the top (root) down to the threshold.\n\n How clustering by threshold works:\n   - We traverse the tree from the root downward until we hit the threshold. \n   - At the threshold, we cut the tree. All nodes (and leaves) that are above the threshold (i.e., have a height >= threshold) are considered connected and form a cluster.\n   - However, note: the threshold is a similarity score. Since we built the tree by merging the most similar pairs first (which have higher scores) and then less similar (lower scores) as we go up, the root has the lowest similarity (because it\'s the merger of the two least similar clusters). \n\n Actually, in our tree building (agglomerative clustering with single linkage) we started by merging the closest (highest similarity) and then built up. The root node has the smallest similarity value because it is the last merge of two clusters that are least similar.\n\n Therefore, when we cut the tree at a threshold T (a similarity score), we want to form clusters such that:\n   - Any two leaves in the same cluster must have a common ancestor node with a similarity score >= T (meaning they merged at a similarity of at least T).\n\n But note: the internal node\'s height (similarity score) represents the similarity at which the two clusters merged. So if we have a threshold T, then we break the tree at points where the node\'s similarity score is less than T. Then the connected components (where edges have similarity >= T) form the clusters.\n\n However, because of the way the tree is built (with the root having the lowest similarity), we can do:\n\n   - We traverse the tree from the leaves upward. We consider that a node (and the subtree below it) forms a cluster if the node\'s height (similarity) is >= T and the parent\'s height is < T (or if it\'s the root). But note: if we have a node with height 1300 and its parent is 1200, and T=1250, then the node (and its children) form a cluster because the connection to the parent (at 1200) is below T.\n\n Alternatively, we can use the following method:\n\n   - We start from the root and traverse downward. We stop at the first node that has a height < T. Then the subtrees of that node\'s children are the clusters.\n\n Actually, the common way is to do a post-order traversal and collect the clusters by cutting at T.\n\n We can use the `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` function `fcluster` if we have a linkage matrix? But note: we built our own tree? \n\n However, in the previous steps, we built a tree using a custom class (we didn\'t show the code for the tree building in the previous responses because the user asked for a summary, but now we need to implement the clustering).\n\n Since the user asked for a production-ready project and we have to avoid decimal points, and we need to use the raw scores, we have two options:\n\n   Option 1: Use a known library (like scipy) and then use `fcluster` to get clusters at a threshold. But note: the linkage matrix in scipy uses distances, not similarities. We would have to convert our similarities to distances? But the user said: "It is extremely important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores".\n\n   Option 2: We have built our own tree. We should have a tree structure (with nodes) that we can traverse. Then we can write a function to cut the tree at a given threshold.\n\n Since the task requires the use of raw Needleman-Wunsch scores and we built the tree with those scores as heights, we can implement a tree cutting function.\n\n Steps for tree cutting:\n\n   - We have a tree where each internal node has:\n        - left child\n        - right child\n        - height (the similarity score at which it was formed)\n\n   - We are given a threshold T (a similarity score)\n\n   - We traverse the tree (post-order) and at each node:\n        - If the node is a leaf: return a singleton cluster [leaf]\n        - Else:\n            - Get the clusters from the left and right subtrees.\n            - If the node\'s height is >= T, then merge the clusters from left and right into one cluster (because at this threshold, they are connected).\n            - Else, return the clusters from left and right as separate.\n\n   However, note: we want to break the tree at the point where the node\'s height is below T. So if the node\'s height is below T, then we don\'t merge the children, but if it\'s above, we do.\n\n   But wait: the root has the smallest height. And we want to break the tree when we see a node that is below T? Actually, we want to break the tree at the edges that have a similarity below T. So the clusters are the connected components of the tree where every edge (from a node to its parent) has a parent\'s height < T? \n\n   Alternatively, we can think: a leaf is connected to its parent. The parent has a height (similarity) which is the similarity of the two children. If the parent\'s height is above T, then the two children are still connected at T. But the connection to the grandparent is at the parent\'s parent height. So we want to form clusters such that we break the tree at the first node (when going up) that has a height < T.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n\n        clusters = []\n        stack = [root]\n        while stack:\n            node = stack.pop()\n            if node.height >= T:\n                # Then we don\'t break here, so we traverse the children and they will be in the same cluster?\n                # Actually, we don\'t form a cluster at this node, because we are above T. We break at the next node below T.\n                # But we can collect all the leaves under this node? \n                # However, note: we are going to break at the next node below T, so we should traverse until we find a node that is below T, then take all the leaves under the last node above T.\n\n        This is complex.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        We traverse the tree and whenever we find a node that is below T, we break the tree at that node and consider the subtrees of its children as separate clusters. But note: if a node is above T, then we don\'t break and we continue to its children? But then we might break at multiple levels.\n\n   Actually, the standard way is to do:\n\n        def get_clusters(node, T):\n            if node is None:\n                return []\n            if node.height < T:\n                # Then we break at this node: so we return the clusters from the left and right subtrees\n                left_clusters = get_clusters(node.left, T)\n                right_clusters = get_clusters(node.right, T)\n                return left_clusters + right_clusters\n            else:\n                # This node is above T, so we don\'t break: we return the cluster that is the entire subtree of this node (all leaves under it)\n                return [get_all_leaves(node)]\n\n        However, note: we don\'t want to break at a node that is above T? Because we want to break only at nodes below T. But if we break at a node that is below T, then we get the clusters from the two children. But if we break at a node that is above T, then we take the entire subtree as one cluster.\n\n        But wait: what if a node above T has children that are also above T? Then we would be returning the entire subtree as one cluster, without breaking at the lower node? That is correct: because the entire subtree is connected at a similarity of at least T.\n\n        However, we must note that the leaves are at height 0? Actually, we didn\'t assign a height to leaves. We should have assigned leaves a height of infinity? Or we can handle leaves differently.\n\n        How did we design the tree node?\n\n        Let\'s assume we have a node class:\n\n            class Node:\n                def __init__(self, id, height, left=None, right=None, name=None):\n                    self.id = id  # internal nodes have negative id? or positive for leaves?\n                    self.height = height  # the similarity score for internal nodes. For leaves, we can set height to a very high value? Or we can treat leaves as having no height? But in our tree building, we only assigned heights to internal nodes.\n\n        Actually, in our tree building, we started by having each leaf as a cluster. Then we merged two clusters (which could be leaves or internal nodes) at a similarity score. The leaf nodes do not have a height that represents a similarity? They are the base.\n\n        We can set the leaf nodes to have a height of infinity? Then when we traverse and see a leaf, we don\'t break? We just return the leaf as a cluster.\n\n        Alternatively, we can design the function to account for leaves:\n\n            if node is a leaf:\n                return [ [node.name] ]\n\n            Then for an internal node:\n                if node.height < T:\n                    return get_clusters(node.left, T) + get_clusters(node.right, T)\n                else:\n                    # we merge the clusters from the left and right into one cluster\n                    left_clusters = get_clusters(node.left, T)   # This returns a list of clusters (each is a list of leaf names)\n                    right_clusters = get_clusters(node.right, T)\n                    # But note: because we are above T, we merge all the clusters from the left and right into one big cluster?\n                    # Actually, we want one cluster for the entire subtree. So we can do:\n                    cluster = []\n                    for c in left_clusters:\n                        cluster.extend(c)\n                    for c in right_clusters:\n                        cluster.extend(c)\n                    return [cluster]\n\n        However, this is inefficient because we are traversing the entire tree and merging lists. Also, note: if the node is above T, then we don\'t break and we return one cluster that is the union of the clusters from the left and right. But wait: what if the left subtree returned multiple clusters? That would happen only if in the left subtree there was a break? But if the current node is above T, then we shouldn\'t break at the current node, so we merge everything under it.\n\n        But if the current node is above T, then we want the entire subtree to be one cluster. However, the recursive calls to the children might break the children into clusters? We don\'t want that. We don\'t break the children if the current node is above T? \n\n        Actually, we should not break the children if the current node is above T because the entire subtree is connected at the current node\'s height (which is above T). Therefore, we should not break at all in the subtree? Then we can just return the entire set of leaves under the node.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if node is a leaf:\n                return [ [node.name] ]\n\n            if node.height < T:\n                # break at this node: so we return the clusters from the left and right without merging\n                return get_clusters(node.left, T) + get_clusters(node.right, T)\n            else:\n                # we do not break at this node, so we return the entire subtree as one cluster\n                leaves = get_all_leaves(node)\n                return [leaves]\n\n        But then we have to write `get_all_leaves` which traverses the entire subtree. We can do that, but it would be inefficient because we are traversing the same nodes multiple times.\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid recursion by doing a BFS from the root and breaking when we hit a node below T? Then we collect the leaves under that node.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            clusters = []\n            stack = [root]\n            while stack:\n                node = stack.pop()\n                if node.height < T:\n                    # break: then we push the children\n                    if node.left:\n                        stack.append(node.left)\n                    if node.right:\n                        stack.append(node.right)\n                else:\n                    # this entire subtree is one cluster\n                    clusters.append(get_all_leaves(node))\n\n        But again, we have to traverse the entire subtree to get the leaves.\n\n        We can precompute the leaves for each node and store it? That would be more efficient.\n\n        Since we are building the tree, we can store at each node the set of leaves (or the list of leaf names) in the subtree.\n\n        How about we store in the node: `node.leaves = set()` and for a leaf node, we set `node.leaves = {node.name}`. For an internal node, we set `node.leaves = node.left.leaves | node.right.leaves`.\n\n        Then the function becomes:\n\n            def get_clusters(root, T):\n                clusters = []\n                stack = [root]\n                while stack:\n                    node = stack.pop()\n                    if node.height < T:\n                        # break and go to children\n                        if hasattr(node, \'left\') and node.left:\n                            stack.append(node.left)\n                        if hasattr(node, \'right\') and node.right:\n                            stack.append(node.right)\n                    else:\n                        # then we take the entire subtree as one cluster\n                        clusters.append(list(node.leaves))\n                return clusters\n\n        But note: what if the root is above T? Then we return one cluster with everything. What if the root is below T? Then we break and push the two children. Then we check the children: if a child is an internal node and its height is below T, we break again? But if a child is a leaf, then we don\'t break? We should treat leaves differently.\n\n        We have to assign leaves a height that is greater than any threshold? Because we don\'t want to break a leaf? We can set leaf.height = float(\'inf\').\n\n        Then the algorithm:\n\n            clusters = []\n            stack = [root]\n            while stack:\n                node = stack.pop()\n                if node.height < T:  # and node is not a leaf? but leaf has inf, so won\'t be < T\n                    # then we break: push children\n                    if node.left:\n                        stack.append(node.left)\n                    if node.right:\n                        stack.append(node.right)\n                else:\n                    clusters.append(list(node.leaves))\n\n        This works.\n\n        Steps:\n          - Precompute the leaves for each node (during tree building).\n          - Assign leaf nodes a height of infinity (or a very large number, but we know the thresholds are from the range of scores, so we can use a value larger than the maximum possible score? e.g., max_score+1, but we don\'t know max_score? or we can use infinity).\n\n        But note: the leaf nodes do not have a height that was assigned by the merging? We set the leaf nodes to have a height of infinity so that they are never broken? Then when we hit a leaf, we just add it as a cluster.\n\n        Actually, we want each leaf to be a cluster if it is broken from its parent? But in our algorithm, if we break at the parent (because the parent\'s height < T), then we push the children (which are leaves or internal nodes). Then when we pop a leaf, since leaf.height = inf, which is >= T, we add it as a cluster.\n\n        So that works.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    We will design a TreeNode class that has:\n        - id (if needed)\n        - height (for internal nodes, and for leaves we set to float(\'inf\'))\n        - left, right (for internal nodes; for leaves, both are None)\n        - name (for leaves, the species name; for internal nodes, we can generate a name or leave as None)\n        - leaves: a set of leaf names in the subtree\n\n    During tree building (hierarchical clustering) we will set these attributes.\n\n    Then we write a function `get_clusters_at_threshold(tree, threshold)` that returns a list of clusters (each cluster is a list of species names).\n\n    Then, for each threshold in the "thresholds.txt" file, we compute the clusters and save the result.\n\n Output format:\n\n    We need to save the clusters for each threshold. How about:\n\n        For threshold T, we create a file named "clusters_T.txt"?\n        Or we can save all in one file? The instruction doesn\'t specify.\n\n    But the instruction says: "Each value in this file, represents a threshold ... I need this program to find out".\n\n    We can output:\n\n        clusters/\n            clusters_blosum50/   (if using blosum50)\n                threshold_1260.txt\n\n        Inside threshold_1260.txt, we can have one cluster per line? And each line is a comma separated list of species names.\n\n    Alternatively, we can output a JSON file for each threshold? Or one big JSON that maps threshold to clusters.\n\n    Since the thresholds file can have multiple thresholds, we\'ll create a directory for the blosum version and then for each threshold a file.\n\n    But the instruction doesn\'t specify. Let me re-read: "I need this program to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold."\n\n    We are free to choose the output format. I propose:\n\n        Output directory: clusters_blosumXX/\n        Inside: for each threshold T, a file named "T.json" that contains a list of clusters, each cluster is a list of species.\n\n    Example: \n        clusters_blosum50/1260.json -> [ ["speciesA", "speciesB"], ["speciesC", "speciesD", "speciesE"] ]\n\n    Alternatively, we can write text files:\n\n        clusters_blosum50/1260.txt:\n            speciesA,speciesB\n            speciesC,speciesD,speciesE\n\n    Since the user might have many thresholds, and the clusters are sets of species, I think JSON is more flexible.\n\n    We\'ll do JSON.\n\n Steps:\n\n    1. Read the thresholds from "thresholds.txt"\n    2. For each threshold T:\n        a. Compute the clusters from the tree (using the method above)\n        b. Save the clusters (list of lists) as JSON in clusters_blosumXX/T.json\n\n    We need to know the blosum version to name the directory.\n\n Implementation:\n\n    We\'ll update the main script to:\n        - Build the tree (if we haven\'t'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 4828, 'total_tokens': 8924, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 4608}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 4608, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 220}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '0613a76a-9c57-4ce1-b18c-e2da410c0e33', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--ec6cb3ec-6652-470b-ba50-801fd33e61ad-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4828, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 8924, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 4608}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

content='' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None, 'reasoning_content': 'We are going to structure the project as follows:\n\n1. We have a module for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and scoring (already done in previous steps).\n2. We have a module for hierarchical clustering (tree building) and dendrogram generation.\n3. We have a module for handling I/O (reading and writing files).\n4. We have a main script that orchestrates the entire process.\n\nFor the third task (clustering based on thresholds), we will:\n- Read the thresholds from "thresholds.txt".\n- For each threshold, traverse the tree (built in the second task) to extract clusters at that threshold.\n- The clusters are sets of leaf nodes (species) that are connected at or above the given threshold.\n\nWe assume that the tree is built using a hierarchical clustering method (agglomerative with single linkage) and stored as a linkage matrix or a tree structure. However, since we built a tree structure (with nodes) in the second task, we can use that.\n\nWe\'ll create a function that, given a tree node and a threshold, returns the clusters (as a list of lists of leaf names) by cutting the tree at that threshold.\n\nSteps for the clustering function:\n1. Traverse the tree from the root.\n2. At each internal node, check the node\'s height (which is the similarity score at which the merge happened).\n3. If the node\'s height is greater than or equal to the threshold, we continue traversing (meaning we go deeper because the node was formed at a higher similarity, so it\'s more recent and we haven\'t reached the threshold going back in time).\n4. If the node\'s height is below the threshold, then we stop and consider the entire subtree as one cluster (because all leaves under this node are connected above the threshold and would form one cluster).\n\nBut note: our tree was built by merging the most similar pairs first (highest scores). The root has the smallest similarity score (because it\'s the oldest) and the leaves have the highest (when comparing a leaf to itself, but note that the leaf nodes are at the height of the last merge that connected them? Actually, in our tree, the leaf nodes are at height 0?).\n\nActually, in the tree we built, the leaf nodes are at the bottom (height 0) and internal nodes have a height equal to the similarity score of the alignment of the two merged clusters. The root node has the smallest similarity score (because it\'s the merge of the last two clusters).\n\nBut when we traverse the tree, we start from the root (which has the smallest value) and go down to the leaves (which have the highest values). So for a given threshold, we want to cut the tree at the point where the node\'s height is below the threshold. This means that any node with height >= threshold is still part of the same cluster? Actually, we want to break the tree when the node\'s height is below the threshold, meaning that the merge happened at a lower similarity (earlier time) than the threshold. Therefore, we want to form clusters of leaves that are connected by nodes with height >= threshold.\n\nSo the algorithm for extracting clusters at threshold T:\n- Start at the root.\n- If the current node is a leaf, return a cluster containing just that leaf.\n- Else, if the current node\'s height is below T, then we return the entire set of leaves under this node as one cluster.\n- Else (if the node\'s height >= T), then we recursively get clusters from the left and right children and return the union (but note: because the node is above the threshold, we are still in the same cluster? Actually, no: we haven\'t reached the threshold yet, so we need to go deeper until we find nodes that are below the threshold).\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n- We traverse the tree and whenever we find a node whose height is less than T, we consider the entire subtree as one cluster and stop. Otherwise, we continue to the children.\n\nBut note: if a node has height >= T, then the two children are still connected at that threshold, so we should not break at that node. We break when the node\'s height is below T.\n\nSo the recursive function:\n  def get_clusters(node, threshold):\n      if node is leaf:\n          return [[node.name]]\n      if node.height < threshold:\n          # This node is below the threshold, so the entire subtree is one cluster\n          leaves = get_all_leaves(node)\n          return [leaves]\n      else:\n          # This node is above the threshold, so we continue to the children\n          left_clusters = get_clusters(node.left, threshold)\n          right_clusters = get_clusters(node.right, threshold)\n          return left_clusters + right_clusters\n\nBut note: we might get multiple clusters from the left and right. And we want to return a list of clusters.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: if the entire tree is above the threshold, then we would break it into individual leaves? That is correct: if the threshold is very high, then we have many clusters (each leaf is a cluster).\n\nBut what if the threshold is above the root\'s height? Then we break at the root and the entire tree is one cluster.\n\nActually, the root is the highest node (with the smallest similarity score). So if the threshold is below the root\'s height, we break at the root? Wait, the root has the smallest score. So if the threshold is set to a value that is higher than the root\'s height, then we break at the root? But the root is the only node, and its height is the smallest. So if the threshold is higher than the root\'s height, then we break at the root and return the entire tree as one cluster? That doesn\'t seem right.\n\nLet me clarify: \n- The root node has height = the similarity score at which the last two clusters were merged. This is the smallest similarity score in the tree (because we merged the least similar clusters last).\n- The leaf nodes have height = 0? Actually, we set the leaf nodes to have height 0. The internal nodes have a height equal to the similarity score of the alignment that caused the merge.\n\nWhen we build the tree, we start with each leaf as a cluster. Then we merge two clusters with the highest similarity score. The new cluster\'s height is that similarity score. Then we continue until we have one cluster (the root).\n\nSo the root has the smallest height (score) and the leaves are at 0. The internal nodes have heights that are the scores at which they were formed.\n\nNow, for a threshold T (a similarity score), we want to form clusters such that any two species that have a similarity score >= T are in the same cluster? Actually, we are using single linkage: the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two elements in the two clusters. So the entire cluster is connected by links of at least T? \n\nBut in the tree, the cluster is formed at a height that is the maximum similarity that connected any two clusters? Actually, in single linkage, the distance between two clusters is the minimum distance between any two points (but we are using similarity). So the similarity between two clusters is the maximum similarity between any two points.\n\nTherefore, the condition for two clusters to be merged is that there exists at least one pair of points (one from each cluster) with similarity >= T? Actually, we want to break the tree when the node\'s height (the similarity at which the two child clusters were merged) is less than T. Then, the two child clusters would be separate because they were merged at a similarity lower than T.\n\nSo the algorithm for cutting the tree at threshold T is:\n  Traverse the tree from the root. For a node:\n    - If the node\'s height is below T, then we break the tree at that node and return the entire set of leaves under that node as one cluster? Actually, no: we break the tree at that node, meaning that we do not merge the two children? So we return two clusters? \n\nBut note: the node represents the merge of two clusters. If the merge happened at a similarity below T, then we should not merge them. Therefore, we return the clusters from the left and the clusters from the right as separate.\n\nHowever, we cannot simply return the two children as two clusters because each child might be a subtree that has multiple clusters at threshold T.\n\nTherefore, we do:\n\n  def get_clusters(node, threshold):\n      if node is leaf:\n          return [[node.name]]\n\n      # If the node\'s height is below the threshold, then we break the connection and return the clusters from the left and right as separate\n      if node.height < threshold:\n          left_clusters = get_clusters(node.left, threshold)\n          right_clusters = get_clusters(node.right, threshold)\n          return left_clusters + right_clusters\n      else:\n          # The node\'s height is above the threshold, so we don\'t break and we merge the two children into one cluster? \n          # But note: we might have already broken the children? Actually, we don\'t break the node, so we want to merge the entire subtree as one cluster?\n          # However, we cannot simply merge the entire subtree because the children might have been broken at a lower level? \n          # Actually, if the node is above the threshold, we don\'t break at this node, but we break at lower nodes (if any) that are below the threshold? \n          # So we still need to traverse the children? \n\n          # But if we don\'t break at this node, then we are still in the same cluster? However, the children might be broken if they have nodes below the threshold? \n          # Therefore, we do the same as above: we get the clusters from the left and the right and then we merge them? \n          # But wait: if we don\'t break at this node, then the entire subtree is one cluster? Actually, no: because the children might have been broken at a lower level. \n\n          # Actually, the condition for breaking is only when we see a node below the threshold. So if the node is above, we do not break and we just combine the clusters from the left and the right? But that would be the same as the left_clusters and right_clusters and then we return them? \n\n          # However, if we don\'t break, then the entire subtree is one cluster? Actually, no: because the children might have been broken? \n\n          # Example: \n          #   Root (height=1000) \n          #      /   \\\n          #   A (height=1200)   B (height=1100)\n          #     / \\              / \\\n          #   L1  L2          L3  L4\n          #\n          # If threshold is 1050, then at the root (1000) we break? But 1000 < 1050 -> break, so we return clusters from left (A) and right (B). \n          # Then at A (1200): 1200>=1050 -> do not break, so we get clusters from A\'s left and right: which are [[L1], [L2]]? \n          # Similarly for B: [[L3],[L4]]. Then we return [[L1],[L2],[L3],[L4]]. \n          #\n          # But if threshold is 950, then at root (1000>=950) -> we do not break. Then we get clusters from A and B. \n          # At A: 1200>=950 -> do not break -> returns clusters from A\'s children: [[L1],[L2]]\n          # At B: 1100>=950 -> do not break -> returns [[L3],[L4]]\n          # Then we combine: [[L1],[L2],[L3],[L4]]? But that is not one cluster? \n\n          # Actually, we want: because the root is above the threshold, we don\'t break at the root, but we break at the children? \n          # But note: the entire tree is connected at the root at 1000, which is above 950, so we want one cluster? \n\n          # The problem: we are breaking the tree only at nodes below the threshold. If a node is above the threshold, we do not break and we return the clusters from the children? But then we lose the fact that the entire subtree is one cluster? \n\n          # Correction: we do not break at a node if it is above the threshold, meaning that the two children are still connected. Therefore, the entire subtree of that node is one cluster? \n\n          # But then we should return a single cluster that is the union of the leaves in the left and right? \n\n          # So the algorithm should be:\n\n          # If the node is a leaf: return a cluster with that leaf.\n          # Else, if node.height < threshold: \n          #   then we break, so return [clusters from left] and [clusters from right] as separate clusters.\n          # Else (node.height >= threshold):\n          #   then we do not break, so we merge the clusters from the left and the right into one big cluster? But wait: the clusters from the left and right might be multiple? \n          #   Actually, if we don\'t break, then the entire subtree is one cluster? \n\n          # So we get the set of leaves from the left and the set of leaves from the right and combine them? \n\n          # But note: the function returns a list of clusters. So we want to return one cluster that is the union of all leaves in the subtree? \n\n          # We can do: \n          #   left_clusters = get_clusters(node.left, threshold)   -> this returns a list of clusters from the left subtree\n          #   right_clusters = get_clusters(node.right, threshold) -> similarly\n          #   then we combine: we have one big cluster = all leaves in left_clusters and right_clusters? \n          #   but note: left_clusters is a list of clusters (each cluster is a list of leaves). We want to flatten them and put in one cluster? \n          #   So the entire subtree becomes one cluster: [ [all leaves] ]\n\n          # However, that would be incorrect because the left and right subtrees might have been broken into multiple clusters? \n\n          # Actually, if the node is above the threshold, then we are not breaking at this node, but we might have broken the left and right subtrees at a lower node? \n\n          # Example: \n          #   Node A (height=1200) has two children: L1 and L2. \n          #   If we break at A?

Actually, we broke the left child? Then we would have multiple clusters from the left? \n          #   But if we broke the left child, then that means there was a node in the left subtree with height below the threshold.

Actually, no: because we broke the left subtree into multiple clusters? \n          # Then at A, we are not breaking, so we are merging the left and right subtrees? But the left subtree has multiple clusters? \n\n          # How do we merge? We merge all the clusters in the left and all the clusters in the right? That would be one big cluster? \n\n          # But that is not correct: because the clusters in the left subtree are not connected to each other by a link above the threshold? They were broken. \n\n          # Actually, the entire subtree of A is not one cluster? Because we broke the left subtree? \n\n          # Therefore, we cannot combine. We just return the clusters from the left and the clusters from the right? \n\n          # But then the node A being above the threshold doesn\'t cause merging? \n\n          # This suggests that we are only breaking at nodes below the threshold, and we are not forcing merging at nodes above the threshold? \n\n          # Actually, the condition is: we break the tree at every node that has height below the threshold. Then the connected components (clusters) are the maximal subtrees that are connected by nodes with height>=threshold? \n\n          # Therefore, we don\'t need to combine clusters at a node above the threshold?

Let\'s recap the requirements and check coverage:\n\n1. **First Task: Needleman-Wunsch Score Calculation**\n   - Read organisms.json and blosumXX.json.\n   - Calculate pairwise Needleman-Wunsch scores (as integers) for all species pairs.\n   - Store scores in a dictionary for fast access.\n   - Save scores to organisms_scores_blosumXX.json.\n\n2. **Second Task: Building the Phylogenetic Tree**\n   - Use single-linkage hierarchical clustering based on similarity (higher score = more similar).\n   - Build a tree where each internal node has a height equal to the similarity score at which the merge occurred.\n   - The tree should be stored in a structure that allows for Newick format export and dendrogram drawing.\n\n3. **Saving the Tree in Newick Format**\n   - Save two versions of the Newick tree:\n        a. Without distances: tree_blosumXX_newick.nw\n        b. With distances (as integers): tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw\n\n4. **Drawing the Dendrogram**\n   - Save a horizontal dendrogram to phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png.\n   - The x-axis (horizontal) should represent the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.\n\n5. **Third Task: Threshold-based Clustering**\n   - Read thresholds from thresholds.txt (each line one integer).\n   - For each threshold, form clusters of species that are connected above that threshold.\n   - Output the clusters to the console and also save to clusters_for_blosumXX.json (key: threshold, value: list of clusters).\n\n6. **General Requirements**\n   - Python 3.11 and specified libraries (we used: argparse, json, os, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, itertools).\n   - Paths relative to current directory, using subfolders (we have modules in alignment/, io/).\n   - PEP-8 compliance, type hints, docstrings, error handling.\n   - Production-ready code.\n\n**Code Structure Recap:**\n\n- `alignment/nw.py`: NeedlemanWunsch class for alignment.\n- `alignment/scorer.py`: BlosumScorer for scoring.\n- `io/reader.py`: Functions to load organisms and BLOSUM matrix.\n- `io/writer.py`: Functions to save scores, trees, and clusters.\n- `tree_builder.py`: Module for building the tree (using hierarchical clustering) and handling Newick format and dendrogram.\n- `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire process.\n\n**Let\'s check coverage of each requirement:**\n\n1. **First Task: Covered**\n   - `main.py` loads organisms and BLOSUM.\n   - Computes pairwise scores (using `NeedlemanWunsch` and `BlosumScorer`).\n   - Saves to JSON via `io.writer.save_scores`.\n\n2. **Second Task: Covered**\n   - In `tree_builder.py`, we have a function `build_tree` that performs hierarchical clustering (using `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage` with method=\'single\') but note: since we are using similarity, we converted to a distance matrix by `distance = max_score - score` (to make higher similarity = lower distance). However, the requirement was to use raw Needleman-Wunsch scores as the height. We adjusted the linkage matrix to use the similarity score as the height of the node.\n\n3. **Newick Format: Covered**\n   - In `tree_builder.py`, we have functions to generate Newick format with and without distances. The tree is saved via `io.writer.save_newick` and `io.writer.save_newick_with_distances`.\n\n4. **Dendrogram: Covered**\n   - In `tree_builder.py`, we have a function `plot_dendrogram` that creates a horizontal dendrogram and saves it as a PNG. The x-axis is the similarity (converted from the distance in the linkage matrix? Actually, we set the `dendrogram` function to use the orientation \'left\' and set the labels. We used the raw similarity scores for the node heights? Actually, we built the linkage matrix with the distance (max_score - score) and then in the dendrogram, we set the `distance_sort` and `show_leaf_counts` appropriately. However, the requirement is that the x-coordinates are the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores. We set the `ax.set_xlabel` to \'Needleman-Wunsch score\' and the ticks are in the score values? \n\n   Note: The dendrogram in scipy is built from the linkage matrix (which is based on distances). We inverted the distances to show the original scores by setting the x-axis limits and labels appropriately? Actually, we stored the original similarity scores as the node heights and used them to label the x-axis? \n\n   Let me clarify: \n   - We built the linkage matrix using the distance matrix (computed as `max_score - pairwise_score`). \n   - The dendrogram function in scipy uses the linkage matrix and the distance matrix to plot. \n   - We then set the x-axis to show the original similarity by inverting the distance? \n\n   However, in the dendrogram plot, the horizontal axis is the distance (which is max_score - similarity). To show the similarity, we can set the x-axis to be from max_score to min_score (so that higher similarity is to the right). Alternatively, we can relabel the x-axis ticks to show the similarity value? \n\n   We did: \n   - We set the x-axis to be the distance (so lower distance = higher similarity). \n   - But the requirement is: "x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances" (meaning the similarity scores). \n\n   Actually, the requirement says: "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". Note: the term "distances" here is a bit confusing because we have been using similarity. However, the problem states that we are using similarity. \n\n   Clarification: The dendrogram should have the x-axis as the similarity score (so higher score = more similar). \n\n   How we handled it:\n   - We built the dendrogram with the distance (so the plot has increasing distance to the right). \n   - We then inverted the x-axis so that the rightmost point is the maximum similarity and leftmost is the minimum? \n\n   Actually, we did not invert the axis. We set the orientation to \'left\' so that the tree grows horizontally. The x-axis then becomes the similarity? \n\n   We set the dendrogram orientation to \'left\' so that the root is at the right and the leaves are on the left. The x-axis (now horizontal and at the top) is the distance (from the linkage). \n\n   We need to relabel the x-axis to show the similarity? \n\n   We did not do that. We set the x-axis to show the distance. \n\n   This is a gap.\n\n   How to fix: \n   - We can compute the similarity from the distance: similarity = max_score - distance. \n   - Then we can set the x-axis ticks and labels to show the similarity. \n\n   Alternatively, we can build the dendrogram with the similarity directly? But the linkage algorithm requires distance. \n\n   We must fix the dendrogram to show the similarity on the x-axis. \n\n   We will: \n   - After creating the dendrogram, we will change the x-axis labels to represent the similarity. \n   - The current x-axis values are the distances (which are max_score - similarity). \n   - We can set new tick positions and label them with the corresponding similarity. \n\n   Example: \n        current x-axis: [0, d1, d2, ..., dmax]\n        we want: [max_score, max_score - d1, max_score - d2, ...] \n\n   Actually, the maximum distance is the maximum of (max_score - similarity) which is max_score - min_similarity. \n\n   We can set the x-axis limits to (0, max_distance) and then set the ticks to the positions we want and label them with the similarity. \n\n   However, note: the dendrogram is built with the distances. The positions of the merges are determined by the distance. \n\n   We can instead flip the x-axis so that the maximum distance (which corresponds to the minimum similarity) is at the left and the minimum distance (maximum similarity) is at the right? \n\n   We can do:\n        ax.invert_xaxis()\n\n   Then the rightmost point is the maximum similarity. \n\n   And then set the x-axis label to "Similarity (Needleman-Wunsch score)".\n\n   We did not do this. \n\n   Therefore, the current dendrogram does not meet the requirement. \n\n   This requirement is partially covered but needs adjustment.\n\n5. **Third Task: Covered**\n   - We have a function in `tree_builder.py` to extract clusters at a given threshold (in terms of similarity). We traverse the tree and form clusters for every threshold. \n   - The threshold is a similarity score: we form clusters by cutting the tree at the threshold (i.e., we consider nodes above the threshold as connected). \n   - We output to console and save to JSON via `io.writer.save_clusters`.\n\n6. **General Requirements: Covered**\n   - We used Python 3.11 and specified the libraries in `requirements.txt`.\n   - All paths are relative to the current directory.\n   - Code is structured in modules, with PEP-8 style, type hints, and docstrings.\n\n**Gap in Dendrogram:**\n\nWe must adjust the dendrogram to have the x-axis represent the Needleman-Wunsch similarity (raw scores) and be oriented horizontally. We will fix by:\n\n1. Inverting the x-axis so that higher similarity (which is the original max_score minus the distance) is on the right.\n2. Relabel the x-axis to show the similarity values? Actually, the dendrogram\'s horizontal axis is the distance (which we want to represent similarity). We can change the tick labels to show the similarity? But the positions are the distances.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the data we pass to the dendrogram? We cannot because the linkage is built on distances.\n\nA better approach: \n   - After plotting, invert the x-axis so that the root (with the maximum similarity) is at the right and the leaves at the left. \n   - Then, we change the x-axis ticks to show the similarity value. \n\nBut note: the dendrogram function in scipy does not allow direct control over the x-axis values. \n\nWe can do:\n\n   - Let `Z` be the linkage matrix (built with distances).\n   - We plot the dendrogram with `dendrogram(Z, orientation=\'left\', ...)`.\n   - Then we invert the x-axis: `ax.invert_xaxis()`\n   - Then we set the x-axis label to "Needleman-Wunsch Similarity Score".\n\nBut the tick values are still the distances. We want to show the similarity. \n\nWe can compute the similarity for the tick positions:\n\n   - The current x-axis ticks are at positions: [d0, d1, d2, ...] (distances).\n   - We want to show: similarity = max_score - d_i.\n\n   We can change the tick labels:\n\n        current_ticks = ax.get_xticks()\n        new_labels = [str(int(max_score - d)) for d in current_ticks]\n        ax.set_xticklabels(new_labels)\n\n   But note: the maximum similarity is the maximum score we had in the pairwise scores? Actually, the root node has a distance of 0? Not exactly: the root node in the dendrogram is the last merge and has the maximum distance? \n\n   Actually, the linkage matrix is built from the distances. The root node (last merge) has the highest distance (which is the diameter of the dataset). \n\n   We stored the maximum similarity score (max_score) that we computed as the maximum value in the pairwise scores? Actually, we computed the distance matrix as:\n\n        max_score = np.max(scores_matrix)   # the highest similarity score\n        dist_matrix = max_score - scores_matrix\n\n   Then the maximum distance is max_score - min_similarity.\n\n   But we don\'t have the max_score in the tree_builder module. We need to pass it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that the entire dendrogram is built from the distance matrix. The root node\'s distance (the last merge) is the maximum distance in the linkage matrix? \n\n   Actually, the linkage matrix has the distances for each merge. The root node\'s distance is the last row\'s distance value.\n\n   However, the distances in the linkage matrix are the distances between clusters at the time of merge. They are not the same as the original pairwise distances? (for single linkage, they are the minimum distance between clusters).\n\n   Therefore, we cannot simply use max_score to convert the entire distance axis to similarity. \n\n   We have two options:\n\n   Option 1: Do not change the tick labels and just invert the axis? Then the x-axis becomes the distance, but we want similarity. This is confusing.\n\n   Option 2: Since the requirement is to have the x-axis determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores, we must use the original similarity scores. But the dendrogram is built on distances. \n\n   We must reconsider: the dendrogram\'s horizontal axis is the distance (which is max_score - similarity). So the position of a node in the dendrogram is determined by the distance. We want to show the similarity. \n\n   We can create a secondary axis? \n\n   Actually, we can change the tick labels to show the similarity. We know that:\n\n        similarity = max_score - distance\n\n   We can compute the max_score from the original pairwise scores. We have the pairwise scores in the main module. We can pass the max_score to the dendrogram plotting function.\n\n   How we will fix:\n\n   - In `tree_builder.plot_dendrogram`, we add a parameter `max_score`.\n   - Then, after creating the dendrogram, we invert the x-axis and then change the tick labels:\n\n        ax.invert_xaxis()\n        # Get current ticks\n        xticks = ax.get_xticks()\n        # Convert each tick from distance to similarity: sim = max_score - dist\n        new_labels = [str(int(max_score - x)) for x in xticks]\n        ax.set_xticklabels(new_labels)\n        ax.set_xlabel("Needleman-Wunsch Similarity Score")\n\n   This will show the similarity on the x-axis.\n\n   But note: the positions of the nodes are still in the distance space. The distances are the horizontal positions. We are just relabeling. \n\n   This meets the requirement: the x-axis is labeled with the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.\n\n   We did not have this in the original code. We must add it.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n1. Adjust the dendrogram plotting function to take `max_score` and relabel the x-axis with similarity values.\n2. In `main.py`, when calling `plot_dendrogram`, pass the `max_score` (which we can compute as the maximum of all pairwise scores).\n\n**Updated Code for Dendrogram (in `tree_builder.py`):**\n\n```python\ndef plot_dendrogram(linkage_matrix: np.ndarray, labels: list, output_path: str, max_score: int):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\n    plt.title(\'Phylogenetic Tree\')\n    plt.xlabel(\'Needleman-Wunsch Similarity Score\')\n    plt.ylabel(\'Species\')\n\n    # Plot the dendrogram\n    dendrogram_data = dendrogram(\n        linkage_matrix,\n        orientation=\'left\',\n        labels=labels,\n        distance_sort=\'descending\',\n        show_leaf_counts=True\n    )\n    ax = plt.gca()\n\n    # Invert the x-axis so that higher similarity is on the right\n    ax.invert_xaxis()\n\n    # Change the x-axis tick labels to show similarity (max_score - distance)\n    xticks = ax.get_xticks()\n    # We want to avoid negative values in case max_score is not high enough? \n    # The distances in the linkage matrix are computed as max_score - similarity, so the maximum distance is max_score - min(similarity). \n    # We compute new labels: sim = max_score - distance\n    new_labels = [str(int(max_score - x)) if x <= max_score else str(0) for x in xticks]\n    ax.set_xticklabels(new_labels)\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.savefig(output_path)\n    plt.close()\n```\n\nAnd in `main.py` when building the tree:\n\n```python\n# ... after building the tree\n# Compute the max_score from the pairwise_scores dictionary?\nmax_score = max(pairwise_scores.values()) if pairwise_scores else 0\n\n# Then when plotting:\nplot_dendrogram(linkage_matrix, species_labels, dendrogram_output_path, max_score)\n```\n\nBut note: the pairwise_scores are for the pairs. The max_score we used in the distance matrix was the maximum of the scores? Actually, in the tree building we did:\n\n```python\n# In tree_builder.build_tree\ndef build_tree(species_names: list, pairwise_scores: dict):\n    # Create a list of species names in order\n    n = len(species_names)\n    # Create a matrix for the scores? \n    # We need a condensed distance matrix (upper triangle) for linkage\n    dist_matrix = np.zeros((n * (n-1)) // 2)\n    # ... but we computed the distance as max_score - score for each pair\n    max_score = max(pairwise_scores.values())\n    # Then we built the condensed distance matrix by: max_score - score for each pair\n```\n\nSo we already computed max_score in the tree building. We can return it from `build_tree` and then pass to `plot_dendrogram`.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute it again in main from `pairwise_scores`. \n\nWe\'ll adjust the `build_tree` function to return the max_score as well.\n\n**Updated Coverage:**\n\nNow all requirements are covered.\n\n**Final Check:**\n\n1. First Task: Covered.\n2. Second Task: Covered (tree building with node heights as similarity).\n3. Newick Format: Covered.\n4. Dendrogram: Now covered with the fix.\n5. Third Task: Covered.\n6.

However, note that we built our own tree. We will use `matplotlib` for plotting and `scipy` only for dendrogram plotting if we can convert our tree to a linkage matrix. Alternatively, we can plot our own tree. Since we built the tree with heights, we can use `dendrogram` from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` by converting our tree to a linkage matrix? But note: our method is single linkage and we are building a tree from similarity scores. Alternatively, we can write our own dendrogram plotting. However, for simplicity and to meet the deadline, we will use `scipy` for dendrogram plotting if we can generate the linkage matrix from our tree.\n\nBut note: we built the tree using agglomerative clustering with single linkage and we have the merge order and heights. We can generate a linkage matrix. The linkage matrix has the format:\n[\n    [idx1, idx2, dist, count],\n    ...\n]\n\nHowever, note: the problem states that we use similarity scores (higher is better) but the dendrogram function expects distances (lower is better). So we have to convert our similarity scores to distances. We can do: distance = max_score - similarity_score, but note that the tree building was done on similarity. Alternatively, we built the tree with the similarity as the height. For the dendrogram, we can use the height as the similarity and then flip the axis? Actually, the dendrogram in `scipy` can be plotted with `orientation=\'left\'` and we can use the `distance_sort` and `count_sort` to get the order.\n\nBut note: the requirement says the dendrogram should be horizontal and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (which are similarities). So we want to have the root at the left (with the highest similarity) and the leaves at the right? Actually, the requirement says "x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". But wait, we have similarities. So we can set the x-axis to be the similarity score? Then we are going to have the root at the right (with the highest score) and the leaves at the left? Or we can invert the axis? Alternatively, we can use the similarity as the distance in the linkage matrix? But the linkage matrix requires distances.\n\nWe have two options:\n1. Convert the similarity to distance: distance = max_score - score. Then the smallest distance is the highest similarity. Then the dendrogram will have the root at the top (if horizontal) and the leaves at the bottom? Actually, we want horizontal so the root would be at the left? But note: the requirement says "x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". So if we use distance, then the root (with distance 0) would be at the left? But our root has the highest similarity (which corresponds to the smallest distance) and the leaves have the largest distance? Actually, the leaves are at distance 0? That doesn\'t match.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the similarity as the height. We built the tree with the height being the similarity. We can plot the dendrogram by using the similarity as the coordinate for the nodes. Then we don\'t need to convert to distance. We can set the x-axis to be the similarity and the dendrogram branches will extend from the root (high similarity) to the leaves (low similarity). This matches the requirement.\n\nSo we will create a custom dendrogram plot? We can use `matplotlib` to draw the tree without `scipy` if we traverse the tree. Since we built the tree, we can write a recursive function to plot it.\n\nBut due to time, we can use `scipy` only for the linkage matrix if we can build it. However, our tree building was custom and we did not use `scipy` for the clustering. So we have the tree structure. We can traverse the tree to generate the linkage matrix? Yes, but note: the linkage matrix requires the indices of the merged clusters and the distance (which we have as similarity) and the size of the cluster. We can do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the `to_linkage_matrix` method in our tree class. We\'ll add that.\n\nBut note: the requirement says to draw the dendrogram horizontally. We can use `scipy`\'s `dendrogram` with `orientation=\'left\'` and then set the x-axis to be the similarity? But the `dendrogram` function by default uses the distance (and we have similarity). We can set the `ax` parameter to invert the x-axis? Or we can set the distance to be (max_similarity - similarity) and then set the labels accordingly? That might be messy.\n\nAlternatively, we can write a custom dendrogram plotter. But that might be complex. Given the time, we decide to use our own tree structure to plot the dendrogram. We\'ll write a recursive function to draw the tree horizontally.\n\nHowever, to keep the project within scope and to use tested libraries, we will generate a linkage matrix from our tree and then use `scipy`\'s `dendrogram` function. We will convert the tree to a linkage matrix and then set the `orientation` to \'left\'. But note: the linkage matrix uses distances. We have stored the height (similarity) at each merge. We can set the distance in the linkage matrix as (max_similarity - similarity) so that the root has the maximum distance? Then when we plot with `orientation=\'left\'`, the root will be at the left? Actually, no: the root will be at the right because the distance is the largest. But we want the root (with the highest similarity) to be at the left? Then we can set the distance to be (max_similarity - similarity) and then set the x-axis to be similarity? Alternatively, we can set the distance to be (similarity) and then the root will have the highest value and the leaves 0? Then we set `orientation=\'left\'` and the root will be at the right? But we want the root at the left.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the distance to be (max_similarity - similarity) and then set the x-axis to be the similarity by relabeling the axis? We can hide the distance axis and set a custom axis with the similarity values? That would be complex.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the requirement says the x coordinates should be the raw Needleman-Wunsch scores (similarity), we can do:\n\nWe can generate the linkage matrix with the distance being (max_similarity - current_similarity) for each merge. Then the dendrogram will show the root at the top (if horizontal) with the smallest distance? Actually, for horizontal orientation, the root would be at the left? Let me check the documentation: `orientation=\'left\'` means the root is at the left and the leaves are at the right. The distance from the root to a leaf is the cumulative distance. But we want the x-axis to be the similarity. So we can set the distance in the linkage matrix to be (max_similarity - similarity) and then set the x-axis limits to [max_similarity, min_similarity] and then set the ticks to the similarity values? But that would be inverted.\n\nAlternatively, we can set the distance to be (max_similarity - similarity) and then invert the x-axis? Then the root would be at the left? Actually, no: if we set the distance to be (max_similarity - similarity), then the root has a distance of 0 and the leaves have a distance of (max_similarity - min_similarity). Then we invert the x-axis so that 0 is at the left and the max distance at the right? Then the root (0) is at the left and the leaves at the right. Then we can set the x-axis labels to be the similarity: at position 0, we put max_similarity, at position max_distance we put min_similarity? But the positions are the distances, not the similarities.\n\nWe can create a custom formatter for the x-axis that converts the distance to similarity: similarity = max_similarity - distance. Then the x-axis would show the similarity. And we set the orientation to \'left\'. Then the root (distance=0) will be at the left and the leaves at the right, and the x-axis will show the similarity.\n\nSo steps for the dendrogram:\n1. Let `max_sim` be the maximum similarity in the tree (the root\'s similarity).\n2. For the linkage matrix, set the distance for each merge to `max_sim - similarity`.\n3. Plot the dendrogram with `orientation=\'left\'`.\n4. Then, for the x-axis, we set the ticks to be at positions: [0, d1, d2, ...] and we label them as [max_sim, max_sim-d1, max_sim-d2, ...] which are the similarities.\n\nBut note: the linkage matrix requires the distance, and we are using `max_sim - similarity` as the distance. Then the dendrogram will show the leaves at the right (with the largest distance) and the root at the left (distance 0). Then we relabel the x-axis to show the similarity: at distance 0 -> max_sim, at distance d -> max_sim - d.\n\nBut note: the requirement says "the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances". We are using the similarity as the basis for the x-axis by relabeling. This meets the requirement.\n\nWe\'ll do it that way.\n\nNow, let\'s generate the code for the entire project.\n\nWe\'ll break down the code by files. Since the entire code is too long, we\'ll generate the most important parts and then the main orchestration.\n\nNote: We assume that the tree building (hierarchical clustering) is implemented in `clustering/hierarchical.py` and it produces a tree that can be converted to a linkage matrix and also to Newick format.\n\nWe\'ll create a class `HierarchicalClustering` that builds the tree and has methods:\n- `fit(similarity_dict)`: builds the tree from a dictionary of pairwise similarities. The keys are tuples (sp1, sp2) and values are the scores.\n- `get_tree()`: returns the root node of the tree.\n- `to_linkage_matrix(labels)`: converts the tree to a linkage matrix for plotting, using the method described above (with distance = max_sim - similarity). The `labels` is the list of leaf labels in the order they appear in the linkage matrix.\n\nThe node class for the tree will have:\n- `id`: an integer id (for internal nodes we assign negative or increasing integers)\n- `height`: the similarity score at which this node was created.\n- `left` and `right`: child nodes.\n- `leaf_name`: if it\'s a leaf, the species name.\n\nWe\'ll also implement the Newick format export in the node class.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are at the final step, we will provide the code for the entire project.\n\nHowever, note: the entire code is too long to generate in one response. We will break it down by files and then we can provide the main orchestration.\n\nWe\'ll generate the code for each file one by one.\n\nLet\'s start with the `alignment` package.\n\nFile: `alignment/nw.py`\n```python\n"""Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm."""\nimport numpy as np\nfrom typing import Tuple, List, Dict\n\nclass NeedlemanWunsch:\n    """Implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment."""\n    \n    def __init__(self, scorer, gap_penalty: int = None):\n        """\n        Initialize with a scorer and optional gap penalty.\n        \n        Args:\n            scorer: Object with method `score(a, b)` for scoring alignment of two characters.\n            gap_penalty: If provided, a fixed gap penalty.

The gap penalty can be set explicitly or taken from the matrix by providing a single letter (we take the gap penalty for \'A\' arbitrarily if not set). But the problem states that the single letter keys are the cost of deleting that letter. We might want to use an average? But the problem says the code should be able to use two different BLOSUM tables. We\'ll require the gap penalty to be set explicitly in the main by using one of the letters? Actually, we are using a fixed gap penalty for all gaps. So we\'ll set it in the main from the matrix by taking the gap penalty for \'A\'. This is arbitrary, but the problem doesn\'t specify. Alternatively, we can require that the matrix has an entry for a special key like \'gap\'? But the problem doesn\'t say. We\'ll assume that the gap penalty is the same for every amino acid? Then we can use any single letter. We\'ll do:\n\nIn `io/reader.py` when loading the matrix, we can set the gap penalty as the value for \'A\'? But what if the matrix doesn\'t have \'A\'? We\'ll use the first single letter we find? Or we can require that the matrix has a key called \'*\'. Given the problem, we\'ll assume that the gap penalty is provided by the matrix for every single letter and they are the same? Then we can pick one.\n\nBut to be safe, we\'ll change the `BlosumScorer`'} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4096, 'prompt_tokens': 5266, 'total_tokens': 9362, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': None, 'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 4096, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 5120}, 'prompt_cache_hit_tokens': 5120, 'prompt_cache_miss_tokens': 146}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-reasoner', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_393bca965e_prod0623_fp8_kvcache', 'id': '009f1345-b9dd-4be4-b5a0-b7508b8a346b', 'service_tier': None, 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='run--81a42aed-cf6c-4287-b328-d63a96ed0e3f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5266, 'output_tokens': 4096, 'total_tokens': 9362, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 5120}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 4096}}
