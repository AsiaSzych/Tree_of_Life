# Conversational Code Generation - gpt-4.1 with python, 08/07/2025, 19:15:16
## Prompt 1

**User:** Goal: Setting up the role LLM should take for this conversation. 
Instruction:  I need to implement a new project from the beginning to end and I will need your help. Through this session, you should act as a senior python developer. I will divide my inputs into descriptions of the task, and requests for code generation. You should always carefully analyze the requirements and constrains. When generating code, make sure it is clean and efficient.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified role. Apply it to every further part of the conversation.

**LLM Response:**

Confirmed. For this session, I will act as a senior Python developer. I will carefully analyze your requirements and constraints, and provide clean, efficient code when requested. Please proceed with your task descriptions or code generation requests.
## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  

**LLM Response:**

Here’s a summary and outline based on your project description:

**Project Summary:**  
You are developing a Python-based pipeline to cluster species based on their amino acid sequences. The process involves calculating pairwise sequence similarities using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a custom substitution (swapping) score dictionary. These similarity scores will be used to construct a phylogenetic tree, visualize it as a dendrogram, and enable clustering of species based on adjustable thresholds.

---

**Project Outline:**

1. **Input Handling**
   - Accept amino acid sequences for multiple species.
   - Ensure input format is consistent (e.g., FASTA, CSV, or direct dictionary).

2. **Similarity Calculation**
   - Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.
   - Use a predefined substitution score dictionary for amino acid swaps.
   - Compute pairwise similarity/distance scores for all species pairs.

3. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
   - Use the similarity/distance matrix to build a phylogenetic tree (e.g., UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining).
   - Ensure compatibility with dendrogram plotting libraries.

4. **Visualization**
   - Generate and display a dendrogram representing the phylogenetic tree.
   - Provide clear labeling for species.

5. **Clustering**
   - Implement clustering based on the dendrogram and user-defined thresholds.
   - Output clusters of species according to chosen similarity/distance cutoffs.

6. **Extensibility & Clean Code**
   - Modularize code for easy updates (e.g., swapping scoring matrices, changing clustering methods).
   - Ensure code is efficient, readable, and well-documented.

---

**Key Considerations:**
- Input validation and error handling.
- Efficient computation for large numbers of sequences.
- Flexibility in scoring and clustering parameters.
- Clear, informative visualizations.

Let me know which part you’d like to start with or if you want to clarify any requirements before proceeding.
## Prompt 3

**User:** Goal: Setting up technical requirements for all code generated through the conversation. 
Instruction: I need this program to be written in python 3.11, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using pyenv to create the environment and pip to install packages. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow PEP formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified requirement. Apply it to every code generated in further parts of conversation, but do not generate any code for this answer.

**LLM Response:**

Confirmed. All code will be written for Python 3.11, using freely chosen libraries as needed. File paths will be relative to the current directory, using subfolders where appropriate. All code will adhere to PEP formatting standards and be clean, efficient, and production-ready. Each code sample or script will be accompanied by the intended filename. No code will be generated in this response. These requirements will be applied to all future code provided in this conversation.
## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

Here is a summary of the requirements and context for the first task:

**Task Overview:**  
You need to implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align amino acid sequences from different species, using a custom substitution matrix (BLOSUM50 or BLOSUM62) provided in a specific JSON format.

**Input Files:**
1. **organisms.json**
   - Structure: Key-value pairs where the key is the species name (string) and the value is its amino acid sequence (string).
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL",
       "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"
     }
     ```

2. **blosumXX.json** (where XX is either 50 or 62)
   - Structure: Key-value pairs representing the substitution matrix.
     - Single-character keys (e.g., "a") represent the deletion cost for that amino acid.
     - Two-character keys (e.g., "ab" or "ba") represent the substitution score for aligning one amino acid to another.
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "a": -1,
       "b": -2,
       "ab": -3,
       "ba": -3,
       "aa": 2,
       "bb": 3
     }
     ```

**Functional Requirements:**
- Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment of two amino acid sequences.
- Use the provided BLOSUM matrix for scoring:
  - Deletion/insertion (gap) penalties are determined by single-character keys.
  - Substitution/match scores are determined by two-character keys.
- The code should be able to switch between BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 matrices between runs, but only one matrix is used per run.
- The implementation should be efficient and production-ready, as it will be used to compute alignments for many pairs of species.

**Constraints & Expectations:**
- Input/output file handling should use relative paths and subfolders as needed.
- Code must follow PEP standards and be clean, modular, and efficient.
- No code is to be generated at this stage; this is a summary of the requirements for the Needleman-Wunsch implementation.

Let me know if you want to clarify or add any requirements before proceeding to code generation.
## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code implements the first task of your project. It reads amino acid sequences from `organisms.json` and a substitution matrix from `blosumXX.json`. For each unique pair of species, it computes the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score using the provided scoring rules (all scores as integers). The results are stored in a nested dictionary for fast access, where `scores[species1][species2]` gives the alignment score between `species1` and `species2`.

The code is organized into two files for clarity and maintainability:

1. **src/needleman_wunsch.py** – Contains the Needleman-Wunsch implementation and file reading utilities.
2. **main.py** – Entry point that loads data, computes all pairwise scores, and prints the results.

**Instructions:**
- Place your `organisms.json` and `blosumXX.json` files in a `data/` subfolder.
- Replace `"blosumXX.json"` in `main.py` with the actual filename (e.g., `"blosum50.json"`).
- Run the project from the root directory using `python main.py`.

**Test Case:**  
With the provided example in your instruction, the output for `testspecies1` vs `testspecies2` will be `7`, as expected.

Let me know if you need further modularization, error handling, or integration with the next steps!
## Prompt 6

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following modification adds functionality to save the computed Needleman-Wunsch scores to a JSON file. The output file is named according to the BLOSUM matrix used (e.g., `organisms_scores_blosum50.json` or `organisms_scores_blosum62.json`). The saved JSON uses keys in the format `"species1_species2"` and integer values for the scores.

The code is divided as follows:
- **src/needleman_wunsch.py**: Adds a function to flatten the nested scores dictionary and save it as a JSON file.
- **main.py**: Determines the output filename based on the BLOSUM file used and calls the save function.

**What this code does:**
- Computes all pairwise Needleman-Wunsch scores for species in `organisms.json` using the selected BLOSUM matrix.
- Flattens the results to a single dictionary with keys like `"species1_species2"`.
- Saves the results as a JSON file in the `data/` directory, with the filename reflecting the BLOSUM matrix used.

**How to use:**
1. Place your `organisms.json` and `blosumXX.json` files in the `data/` subfolder.
2. In `main.py`, set the correct BLOSUM file (e.g., `"blosum50.json"` or `"blosum62.json"`).
3. Run `python main.py` from the root directory.
4. The results will be saved as `data/organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`.

## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

Here is a summary of the requirements and context for the second task:

**Task Overview:**  
You need to build a phylogenetic tree (a "tree of life") using the previously calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores between species. This tree will represent evolutionary relationships, with the most similar species (highest similarity scores) being merged first, and internal nodes representing common ancestors. The process is analogous to agglomerative hierarchical clustering using single linkage, but it must operate on similarity scores (not distances).

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Input:**  
   - Use the similarity scores from the previously generated `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` file.
   - The scores are raw Needleman-Wunsch values (integers), with higher values indicating greater similarity.

2. **Clustering/Tree Construction:**  
   - Perform agglomerative hierarchical clustering using single linkage, but based on maximum similarity (not minimum distance).
   - At each step, merge the pair of clusters with the highest similarity score.
   - The tree structure must preserve and operate on the raw similarity scores, as these will be used in later steps.

3. **Tree Structure:**  
   - The resulting tree should allow for:
     - Traversal and extraction of clusters based on similarity thresholds (i.e., cut the tree at a given similarity score to get clusters).
     - Visualization as a dendrogram.
     - Export to Newick format for compatibility with other tools.

4. **Preparation for Later Tasks:**  
   - The tree structure and code should be designed to easily support:
     - Drawing a dendrogram.
     - Saving the tree in Newick format.
     - Extracting clusters for user-defined similarity thresholds (which will be provided in a `thresholds.txt` file, with values chosen directly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores).

5. **Constraints:**  
   - Most standard libraries for hierarchical clustering (e.g., scipy) operate on distances, not similarities. The solution must be custom or adapted to work directly with similarity scores.
   - The code must be clean, modular, and production-ready, as with previous tasks.

**Summary:**  
You require a custom agglomerative clustering algorithm (single linkage) that merges clusters based on maximum similarity (Needleman-Wunsch scores), not minimum distance. The resulting tree must support further operations such as threshold-based clustering, dendrogram visualization, and Newick export, all while preserving the original similarity scores.

Let me know if you want to clarify or add any requirements before proceeding to code generation.
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code introduces a custom tree structure and an agglomerative clustering algorithm (single linkage) that operates directly on Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores. The code builds a phylogenetic tree where each merge creates an internal node with its height set to the similarity score at which the merge occurred. The tree structure is designed to support future tasks such as dendrogram drawing and Newick export.

**Code Structure:**
- **src/tree.py**: Defines the `TreeNode` class and the clustering algorithm.
- **main.py**: Loads the similarity scores, builds the tree, and prints a summary.

**What this code does:**
- Loads Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores from a JSON file.
- Builds a phylogenetic tree using single-linkage clustering, merging the most similar clusters at each step.
- Each internal node records the similarity score (height) at which the merge occurred.
- Prints a summary of the resulting tree structure.

**How to use:**
1. Place your similarity scores file (e.g., `organisms_scores_blosum50.json`) in the `data/` subfolder.
2. In `main.py`, set the correct filename for the scores file.
3. Run `python main.py` from the root directory.
4. The tree structure will be printed to the console.

**Ready for extension:**  
The `TreeNode` structure and clustering logic are designed for easy extension to dendrogram drawing and Newick export in future steps. Let me know if you need further modularization or additional features!
## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
This modification adds functionality to export the phylogenetic tree to two Newick format files:
1. **Standard Newick** (only leaf names): e.g. `(A,B,(C,D));`
2. **Newick with branch lengths** (leaf names and integer distances): e.g. `(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);`

The code is organized as follows:
- **src/tree.py**: Adds methods to convert the tree to both Newick formats.
- **main.py**: Determines the correct output filenames based on the BLOSUM version and saves the tree in both formats.

## Prompt 10

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for drawing a dendrogram of created tree.
Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
This modification adds functionality to visualize the phylogenetic tree as a horizontal dendrogram, where the x-axis represents the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores (heights from the tree). The dendrogram is saved as a PNG file named according to the BLOSUM version used (e.g., `phylogenetic_tree_blosum50.png`).  
The code uses `matplotlib` for plotting and is organized as follows:
- **src/tree.py**: Adds a function to plot the dendrogram from the custom tree structure.
- **main.py**: Calls the plotting function and saves the dendrogram with the correct filename.

**What this code does:**
- Adds a `plot_dendrogram` function to `src/tree.py` that draws a horizontal dendrogram using the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores for the x-axis.
- In `main.py`, after building the tree, calls `plot_dendrogram` and saves the PNG file in the `data/` directory with the correct BLOSUM version in the filename.

**How to use:**
1. Ensure you have `matplotlib` installed (`pip install matplotlib`).
2. Place your similarity scores file (e.g., `organisms_scores_blosum50.json`) in the `data/` subfolder.
3. In `main.py`, set the correct filename for the scores file.
4. Run `python main.py` from the root directory.
5. The dendrogram will be saved as `data/phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png`.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional features!
## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 

**LLM Response:**

Here is a summary of the requirements and context for the third (final) task:

**Task Overview:**  
You need to identify clusters of species (leaf nodes) in the phylogenetic tree based on given similarity thresholds. For each threshold, you will "cut" the tree at that similarity value and determine which species remain connected below this cut—these groups form the clusters.

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Input:**  
   - The phylogenetic tree built from previous steps (with internal node heights set to Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores).
   - A file called `thresholds.txt`, where each line contains a single integer threshold value (e.g., `1260`).

2. **Clustering Logic:**  
   - For each threshold value:
     - Conceptually "cut" the tree at that similarity score.
     - Any connections (branches) above this threshold are ignored.
     - The remaining connected groups of leaf nodes (species) below this threshold form the clusters.
   - Each cluster is a set of species that are still connected below the threshold.

3. **Thresholds:**  
   - Threshold values are always integers and will be within the range of the Needleman-Wunsch scores used for tree construction.

4. **Output (for future steps):**  
   - For each threshold, you will need to output the clusters (groups of species) identified at that threshold.
   - The output format and file requirements will be specified in the next step.

5. **Constraints:**  
   - The clustering must be based on the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores (not distances).
   - The solution must efficiently traverse the tree and extract clusters for each threshold.

**Summary:**  
Given a list of integer similarity thresholds, you need to traverse the phylogenetic tree and, for each threshold, identify all clusters of species that remain connected below that threshold. Each cluster is a set of leaf nodes (species) that are still joined together at or below the threshold value.

Let me know if you want to clarify or add any requirements before proceeding to code generation.
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.

**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
This modification adds functionality to:
- Read thresholds from `thresholds.txt`.
- For each threshold, traverse the phylogenetic tree and find clusters of leaf nodes (species) that remain connected below the threshold.
- Print the clusters for each threshold to standard output.
- Save the clusters for all thresholds to a JSON file named `clusters_for_blosumXX.json`, where `XX` is the BLOSUM version used.

The code is organized as follows:
- **src/tree.py**: Adds a function to extract clusters from the tree given a threshold.
- **main.py**: Reads thresholds, computes clusters, prints and saves the results.

**What this code does:**
- Reads thresholds from `thresholds.txt`.
- For each threshold, finds clusters of species connected below that threshold.
- Prints clusters for each threshold to standard output.
- Saves all clusters for all thresholds to `data/clusters_for_blosumXX.json` as a dictionary mapping threshold values to lists of clusters.

**How to use:**
1. Place your similarity scores file (e.g., `organisms_scores_blosum50.json`) and `thresholds.txt` in the `data/` subfolder.
2. In `main.py`, set the correct filename for the scores file.
3. Run `python main.py` from the root directory.
4. The clusters for each threshold will be printed and saved as `data/clusters_for_blosumXX.json`.

## Prompt 13

**User:** Goal: Checking if provided solution covers all previously mentioned requirements.
Instruction: This was the end of coding tasks for this project. Right now all functionalities should be covered. The final code should start with reading input “blosumXX.json” and “organism.json” files and at the end print clusters for thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file to the standard output. Additionally, saving intermediate outputs as previously mentioned. This will be considered as a successful implementation. Now it is time to check if this implementation covers all requirements. Remember that implemented solutions must be of high quality. 
Expected Output: List of all previously provided requirements with short note on whether or not it is covered in the generated code.

**LLM Response:**

Certainly! Here is a checklist of all previously provided requirements, each with a note on whether and how it is covered in the generated code:

---

**Requirement:**  
- All code must be Python 3.11 compatible, PEP8-compliant, modular, and production-ready.
**Status:**  
- **Covered.** All code is written for Python 3.11, divided into logical modules, and follows PEP8 conventions.

---

### 2. **Input Handling**
**Requirement:**  
- Read amino acid sequences from `organisms.json`.
- Read BLOSUM substitution matrix from `blosumXX.json`.
- Use relative paths and subfolders.
**Status:**  
- **Covered.** Utility functions load both files from the `data/` subfolder using relative paths.

---

### 3. **Needleman-Wunsch Similarity Calculation**
**Requirement:**  
- Implement Needleman-Wunsch algorithm using custom BLOSUM matrix.
- Use integer scores only.
- Calculate all pairwise scores for species.
**Status:**  
- **Covered.** The algorithm is implemented with integer-only scores, using the custom BLOSUM matrix, and computes all pairwise similarities.

---

### 4. **Efficient Storage and Saving of Similarity Scores**
**Requirement:**  
- Store scores in a structure with fast access.
- Save scores to `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` in the required key-value format.
**Status:**  
- **Covered.** Scores are stored in a dictionary and saved in the specified JSON format.

---

### 5. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
**Requirement:**  
- Build a tree using single-linkage agglomerative clustering.
- Merge clusters by highest similarity (not lowest distance).
- Internal nodes must store the Needleman-Wunsch score as their height.
**Status:**  
- **Covered.** Custom clustering logic merges by highest similarity, and internal nodes store the merge score as height.

---

### 6. **Tree Structure for Further Use**
**Requirement:**  
- Tree must support traversal, dendrogram drawing, Newick export, and threshold-based clustering.
**Status:**  
- **Covered.** The `TreeNode` class and tree-building logic support all these operations.

---

### 7. **Newick Format Export**
**Requirement:**  
- Export tree to standard Newick format (leaf names only) and Newick with integer branch lengths.
- Save as `tree_blosumXX_newick.nw` and `tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`.
**Status:**  
- **Covered.** Both formats are generated and saved with the correct filenames.

---

### 8. **Dendrogram Visualization**
**Requirement:**  
- Draw a horizontal dendrogram with x-axis as Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.

# Phylogenetic Tree Construction and Clustering

## Overview

This project computes pairwise similarity scores between species using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a custom BLOSUM matrix, builds a phylogenetic tree, exports it in Newick format, draws a dendrogram, and finds clusters of species based on similarity thresholds.

## Setup

1. **Python Version:**  
   Ensure you are using Python 3.11 (recommended: use `pyenv`).

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare input files:**  
   Place your input files in the `data/` directory:
   - `organisms.json` (species and sequences)
   - `blosum50.json` or `blosum62.json` (BLOSUM matrix)
   - `thresholds.txt` (one integer threshold per line)

## Running the Program

1. Edit `main.py` to specify which BLOSUM file you want to use.
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Outputs

- Pairwise similarity scores: `data/organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`
- Phylogenetic tree in Newick format: `data/tree_blosumXX_newick.nw`
- Phylogenetic tree in Newick format with distances: `data/tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`
- Dendrogram PNG: `data/phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png`
- Clusters for thresholds: `data/clusters_for_blosumXX.json`

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — Main entry point for the workflow.
- `src/tree.py` — Tree construction, Newick export, dendrogram plotting, and clustering logic.
- `data/` — Input and output files.
