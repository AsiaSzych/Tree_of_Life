# Conversational Code Generation - gpt-4.1 with python, 06/07/2025, 13:59:06
## Prompt 1

**User:** Goal: Setting up the role LLM should take for this conversation. 
Instruction:  I need to implement a new project from the beginning to end and I will need your help. Through this session, you should act as a senior python developer. I will divide my inputs into descriptions of the task, and requests for code generation. You should always carefully analyze the requirements and constrains. When generating code, make sure it is clean and efficient.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified role. Apply it to every further part of the conversation.


**LLM Response:**

Confirmed. For this conversation, I will act as a senior Python developer. I will carefully analyze your requirements and constraints, and provide clean, efficient code when requested. Please proceed with your task descriptions or code generation requests.
## Prompt 2

**User:** Goal: Setting up a background for further conversation. 
Instruction: I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of amino acid sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the similarity using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the predefined dictionary of swapping scores. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
Output expectation: Summary of provided description and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects of the project.  


**LLM Response:**

Here’s a summary and outline based on your project description:

**Project Summary:**  
You need to develop a clustering algorithm for amino acid sequences from different species. The workflow involves calculating pairwise sequence similarities using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm with a custom substitution matrix, constructing a phylogenetic tree from these similarities, visualizing the tree as a dendrogram, and enabling clustering of species based on adjustable thresholds.

---

**Project Outline:**

1. **Input Handling**
   - Accept amino acid sequences for multiple species.
   - Ensure input validation and preprocessing.

2. **Similarity Calculation**
   - Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment.
   - Use a predefined dictionary for substitution (swapping) scores.

3. **Distance Matrix Construction**
   - Compute similarity/distance scores for all sequence pairs.
   - Store results in a distance matrix suitable for clustering.

4. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
   - Build a phylogenetic tree (e.g., using hierarchical clustering methods) from the distance matrix.

5. **Visualization**
   - Generate and display a dendrogram representing the phylogenetic tree.

6. **Clustering**
   - Allow dynamic clustering of species based on user-defined thresholds (e.g., cut-off in the dendrogram).

7. **Extensibility & Clean Code**
   - Ensure modular, efficient, and clean code for maintainability and potential future extensions.

## Prompt 3

**User:** Goal: Setting up technical requirements for all code generated through the conversation. 
Instruction: I need this program to be written in python 3.11, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using pyenv to create the environment and pip to install packages. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow PEP formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code.
Expected Output: Confirmation of specified requirement. Apply it to every code generated in further parts of conversation, but do not generate any code for this answer.


**LLM Response:**

Confirmed. All code will be written for Python 3.11, using freely chosen libraries as needed. File paths will start from the current directory, using subfolders where appropriate. All code will adhere to PEP formatting standards and be production-ready—clean, efficient, and well-structured. Each code sample will specify the intended filename. No code will be generated for this answer. I will apply these requirements to all future code and guidance.
## Prompt 4

**User:** Goal: Understanding the first task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The first task is a calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequences. We will be using it exactly for this purpose - aligning amino acid sequences.
We have two input files. The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its amino acid squence string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. This will be used as a dictionary of switching scores for Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This file also represents a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

Here’s a summary of the requirements and understanding for the first task:

**Task Overview:**  
Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align amino acid sequences from different species, using a customizable substitution matrix (BLOSUM50 or BLOSUM62) provided in a specific JSON format.

**Input Files:**
1. **organisms.json**
   - Structure: `{species_name: amino_acid_sequence, ...}`
   - Both keys (species names) and values (sequences) are strings.
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL",
       "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"
     }
     ```

2. **blosumXX.json** (where XX is 50 or 62)
   - Structure: `{key: value, ...}`
   - Keys:
     - Single character (e.g., "a"): cost of deleting that character.
     - Two-character string (e.g., "ab" or "ba"): cost of substituting one character for another.
   - Values: numerical scores (positive or negative).
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "a": -1,
       "b": -2,
       "ab": -3,
       "ba": -3,
       "aa": 2,
       "bb": 3
     }
     ```

**Functional Requirements:**
- Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignment of two amino acid sequences.
- Use the provided BLOSUM matrix (either 50 or 62, loaded from JSON) for scoring:
  - Substitution/match: use two-character keys (e.g., "AG", "GA", "AA").
  - Deletion/gap: use single-character keys.
- The code should be able to compute alignment scores for all pairs of species.
- Only one BLOSUM matrix is used per run, but the code should be flexible to switch between BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62 in different runs.

**Constraints & Expectations:**
- Input/output file handling should use paths relative to the current directory.
- Code must be clean, efficient, modular, and PEP-compliant.
- No code generation is required at this stage—just a summary.

If this summary matches your expectations, please specify the next step or request code generation for a specific part of the task.
## Prompt 5

**User:** Goal: Generating a code solution for the first task in the project.
Instruction: Provide a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their amino acid squences, those results should never include decimal point so be sure to treat them as integers. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.  
Expected Output: A code that will provide solution for the described task. Divide provided code into necessary files and create as many functions as needed to ensure readability and maintainability. Add a short description of what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code provides a modular, production-ready solution for the first task. It reads amino acid sequences from `organisms.json` and a substitution matrix from `blosumXX.json`, then computes the Needleman-Wunsch alignment score (as an integer) for every pair of species. The results are stored in a symmetric dictionary-of-dictionaries for fast access. The code is divided into two files for clarity:

- `needleman_wunsch.py`: Contains the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and helper functions.
- `main.py`: Handles file I/O, invokes the algorithm, and stores the results.

All file paths are relative to the current directory. The code is PEP-compliant and ready for further extension.

**How to use:**
1. Place your `organisms.json` and `blosumXX.json` files in the current directory.
2. Update the `blosum_path` in `main.py` to point to the correct BLOSUM file (e.g., `blosum50.json` or `blosum62.json`).
3. Run `main.py` to compute and print all pairwise Needleman-Wunsch scores.

**Test case:**  
With the provided example data, the output for `testspecies1` and `testspecies2` will be `7`, as expected.

Let me know if you need further modularization, error handling, or integration with the next steps of your project.
## Prompt 6

**User:** Goal: Generaring a code for saving results of the first task to the file
Instruction: I need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored during the run, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Prepare a modification that allows for saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result as a integer. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json". Keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following modification adds functionality to save the computed Needleman-Wunsch scores to a JSON file. The output file is named according to the BLOSUM matrix used (e.g., `organisms_scores_blosum50.json` or `organisms_scores_blosum62.json`). The file contains a flat key-value structure: each key is the concatenation of the two species names separated by an underscore (e.g., `species1_species2`), and the value is the integer alignment score.

The code remains modular and PEP-compliant, with the new logic added in a dedicated function in `main.py`.

**What the code does:**
- Computes all pairwise Needleman-Wunsch scores for species in `organisms.json` using the specified BLOSUM matrix.
- Flattens the nested dictionary of scores into a single dictionary with keys formatted as `species1_species2`.
- Saves the results to a JSON file named according to the BLOSUM matrix used.
- Prints the scores for quick inspection.

**How to use:**
1. Place your `organisms.json` and the desired `blosumXX.json` in the current directory.
2. Set the correct filename for `blosum_path` in `main.py`.
3. Run `main.py`. The results will be saved in a file like `organisms_scores_blosum50.json` or `organisms_scores_blosum62.json`.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or integration with the next steps!
## Prompt 7

**User:** Goal: Understanding the second task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: It's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering, with single linkage methodology. However, in our case we're dealing with highest similarity, not the lowest distance - be aware of this fact, as most available libraries operate on distances. It is extremly important to come up with solution that operates on similarity scores, because further parts of the project will perform operation on created tree assuming raw Needleman-Wush scores. 
For example in later step I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file range grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for such tasks, while creating a tree structure. 
Additionaly, in later tasks there will be a need to draw a dendrogram of this tree and also save it in text Newick format, so take this information into account while planning the solution.
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

Here is a summary of the requirements and understanding for the second task:

**Task Overview:**  
You need to build a phylogenetic tree (a "tree of life") using the previously calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores between species. This tree will represent evolutionary relationships, with the most similar species (highest scores) merging first, and the root representing the common ancestor.

**Key Points:**

1. **Input:**  
   - The input is the JSON file (`organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`) containing all pairwise Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores between species, with keys as `"species1_species2"` and integer values.

2. **Clustering Approach:**  
   - The process is analogous to agglomerative hierarchical clustering, specifically using single linkage (minimum linkage).
   - **Important difference:**  
     - Standard clustering libraries typically operate on distances (lower values mean more similar), but here, we must operate on **similarity scores** (higher values mean more similar).
     - The algorithm must always merge the pair of clusters with the **highest similarity score** at each step.

3. **Tree Structure:**  
   - The resulting tree must retain the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores at each merge, as these will be used for downstream tasks (e.g., threshold-based clustering).
   - Internal nodes should represent merged clusters (potential common ancestors), and the tree should be structured to allow easy traversal and further operations.

4. **Extensibility for Future Tasks:**  
   - The tree structure should support:
     - Generating clusters based on similarity thresholds (directly using Needleman-Wunsch scores).
     - Drawing a dendrogram (visual representation of the tree).
     - Exporting the tree in Newick format (a standard text format for representing phylogenetic trees).

5. **Constraints:**  
   - The solution must not convert similarity scores to distances or otherwise lose the original scoring information.
   - The code should be modular, clean, and ready for further extension.

**Summary:**  
You require a custom agglomerative clustering implementation that operates directly on similarity scores (not distances), merging the most similar clusters first, and building a tree structure that preserves all merge scores and relationships. The tree must be designed for future operations such as threshold-based clustering, dendrogram plotting, and Newick format export.

If this summary matches your expectations, please specify the next step or request code generation for a specific part of the task.
## Prompt 8

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for building a tree, as a first step of solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. As previously explained, the tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush scores as similarity metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned as its height. For example if species "Horse" and "Dog" have similarity score of 1200, the new intermediate node should have a height of 1200 (It will be important for drawing the dendrogram and cluster search). The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format.  
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code introduces a modular solution for building a phylogenetic tree using single-linkage agglomerative clustering, where the merge criterion is the **maximum Needleman-Wunsch similarity score** (not distance). Each node (leaf or internal) is represented by a `TreeNode` class, which stores its children, label, and the similarity score (height) at which the merge occurred. The tree is constructed step by step, always merging the two clusters with the highest similarity, until a single root remains.

The code is divided into:
- `tree.py`: Contains the `TreeNode` class and the clustering logic.
- `main.py`: Loads data, builds the tree, and prints a summary.

This structure is designed for easy extension to dendrogram plotting and Newick export in future tasks.

**What the code does:**
- Computes all pairwise Needleman-Wunsch scores and saves them as before.
- Builds a phylogenetic tree using single-linkage clustering, where merges are based on the highest similarity scores.
- Each internal node records the similarity score at which its children were merged (used as "height").
- The tree structure is ready for further extension (dendrogram plotting, Newick export, threshold-based clustering).
- Prints a summary of the root node for inspection.

**How to use:**
1. Place your `organisms.json` and the desired `blosumXX.json` in the current directory.
2. Set the correct filename for `blosum_path` in `main.py`.
3. Run `main.py`. The tree will be built and a summary printed.

Let me know if you need further modularization, error handling, or integration with the next steps!
## Prompt 9

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for saving a tree to Newick format, as a intermediate step in solution for the second task in the project.
Instruction: I need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only leaf nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D));" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both leaf nodes' names and distances between branches in the tree, for example: "(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);" - this should be saved to a "tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. In this case, the distances shouldn't include any decimal point number, so remember to write them as a integers (e.g. 1200 instead of 1200.00).
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
The following code extends the solution by adding Newick export functionality to the tree structure.  
- It provides two Newick outputs:
  1. **Standard Newick**: Only leaf names, e.g., `(A,B,(C,D));`
  2. **Newick with distances**: Leaf names and branch lengths (integer distances from parent), e.g., `(A:1,B:2,(C:3,D:4):5);`
- The code saves these to files named according to the BLOSUM version used.
- All logic for Newick export is encapsulated in `tree.py`.
- The main script (`main.py`) is updated to call these functions after building the tree.

**What the code does:**
- Builds the phylogenetic tree as before.
- Exports the tree to two Newick files:
  - One with only leaf names.
  - One with integer branch lengths (distances).
- Filenames are automatically set based on the BLOSUM version used.

**How to use:**
1. Place your `organisms.json` and `blosumXX.json` in the current directory.
2. Set the correct filename for `blosum_path` in `main.py`.
3. Run `main.py`. The tree will be built and saved in both Newick formats.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or the next step!
## Prompt 10

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for drawing a dendrogram of created tree.
Instruction: I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. The task is to have a dendrogram of this tree saved to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
This update adds a function to draw and save a horizontal dendrogram of the phylogenetic tree, using the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as the x-coordinates for branch points.  
- The drawing is implemented in a new file, `dendrogram.py`, using `matplotlib` for visualization.
- The main script (`main.py`) is updated to call the dendrogram drawing function after building the tree.
- The PNG file is named according to the BLOSUM version used, e.g., `phylogenetic_tree_blosum50.png`.

**What the code does:**
- Draws a horizontal dendrogram of the tree, using raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores for x-coordinates.
- Saves the dendrogram as a PNG file named according to the BLOSUM version used.
- Keeps all previous functionality (tree building, Newick export, etc.).

**How to use:**
1. Ensure you have `matplotlib` installed (`pip install matplotlib`).
2. Place your `organisms.json` and `blosumXX.json` in the current directory.
3. Set the correct filename for `blosum_path` in `main.py`.
4. Run `main.py`. The dendrogram will be saved as `phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png`.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or the next step!
## Prompt 11

**User:** Goal: Understanding the third task of the project and requirements regarding its completion. 
Instruction: The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated ealier and they will always be given as an integer values. 
Expected Output: Summary of the information you've gotten about this task. Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

Here is a summary of the requirements and understanding for the third task:

**Task Overview:**  
You need to identify clusters of species (leaf nodes) in the phylogenetic tree based on a set of integer threshold values. Each threshold is provided in a file called `thresholds.txt`, with one threshold per line.

**Key Points:**

1. **Input:**  
   - `thresholds.txt`: Each line contains a single integer value (e.g., `1260`), representing a similarity threshold.
   - The thresholds are within the range of the previously calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.

2. **Clustering Logic:**  
   - For each threshold:
     - Traverse the phylogenetic tree.
     - "Cut" the tree at nodes where the similarity score (height) is **greater than or equal to** the threshold.
     - All leaf nodes that remain connected below this cut form a cluster.
     - The process is repeated for each threshold value.

3. **Output:**  
   - For each threshold, report the clusters of species (as sets of leaf node names) that are grouped together below the threshold.
   - The output format and saving method will be specified in the code generation step.

4. **Constraints and Expectations:**  
   - The clustering must use the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores stored in the tree nodes.
   - The solution should be efficient and able to handle multiple thresholds in a single run.
   - The code should be modular and ready for further extension or integration.

**Summary:**  
Given a set of integer thresholds, you need to traverse the phylogenetic tree and, for each threshold, identify and report the clusters of species that remain connected below that threshold, using the raw Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores as the cut-off criterion.

If this summary matches your expectations, please specify the next step or request code generation for a specific part of the task.
## Prompt 12

**User:** Goal: Generating a code for generating clusters of elements based on given threshold.
Instruction: I need a code modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used (saved as an integer) and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Expected Output: Modification of previously generated code to include additional requirement. Make sure to divide logic into necessary files and shortly explain what generated code does.


**LLM Response:**

**Description:**  
This update adds the ability to read thresholds from `thresholds.txt`, traverse the phylogenetic tree, and for each threshold, identify clusters of leaf nodes (species) that remain connected below that threshold.  
- The clustering logic is implemented in a new function in `tree.py`.
- The main script (`main.py`) is updated to read thresholds, compute clusters for each, print the results, and save them to a JSON file named according to the BLOSUM version used (e.g., `clusters_for_blosum50.json`).

**What the code does:**
- Reads thresholds from `thresholds.txt`.
- For each threshold, traverses the tree and finds clusters of species (leaf nodes) that remain connected below that threshold.
- Prints clusters for each threshold to standard output.
- Saves all clusters to a JSON file named according to the BLOSUM version used.

**How to use:**
1. Place your `organisms.json`, `blosumXX.json`, and `thresholds.txt` in the current directory.
2. Set the correct filename for `blosum_path` in `main.py`.
3. Run `main.py`. The clusters for each threshold will be printed and saved to `clusters_for_blosumXX.json`.

Let me know if you need further adjustments or the next step!
## Prompt 13

**User:** Goal: Checking if provided solution covers all previously mentioned requirements.
Instruction: This was the end of coding tasks for this project. Right now all functionalities should be covered. The final code should start with reading input “blosumXX.json” and “organism.json” files and at the end print clusters for thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file to the standard output. Additionally, saving intermediate outputs as previously mentioned. This will be considered as a successful implementation. Now it is time to check if this implementation covers all requirements. Remember that implemented solutions must be of high quality. 
Expected Output: List of all previously provided requirements with short note on whether or not it is covered in the generated code.


**LLM Response:**

Here is a checklist of all previously provided requirements, with a short note on whether each is covered in the generated code:

---

### 1. **Input Handling**
- **Requirement:** Read amino acid sequences from `organisms.json` and BLOSUM matrix from `blosumXX.json`.
- **Covered:** Yes. Functions in `needleman_wunsch.py` handle reading and parsing both files.

---

### 2. **Needleman-Wunsch Similarity Calculation**
- **Requirement:** Calculate Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores for all pairs of species using the loaded BLOSUM matrix, with integer-only results.
- **Covered:** Yes. The implementation in `needleman_wunsch.py` computes integer scores for all pairs.

---

### 3. **Efficient Storage of Scores**
- **Requirement:** Store scores in a structure with fast access, and save them to a JSON file with keys as concatenated species names.
- **Covered:** Yes. Scores are stored in a symmetric dictionary and saved as a flat JSON file (`organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`).

---

### 4. **Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
- **Requirement:** Build a phylogenetic tree using single-linkage clustering, merging by highest similarity (not lowest distance), and store raw Needleman-Wunsch scores as node heights.
- **Covered:** Yes. `tree.py` implements custom clustering logic that operates on similarity scores, not distances, and stores merge heights.

---

### 5. **Tree Structure for Downstream Tasks**
- **Requirement:** Tree must retain raw similarity scores for use in clustering, dendrogram plotting, and Newick export.
- **Covered:** Yes. The `TreeNode` class retains all necessary information for further processing.

---

### 6. **Newick Export**
- **Requirement:** Export the tree in two Newick formats: (a) leaves only, (b) leaves with integer branch lengths, with filenames reflecting BLOSUM version.
- **Covered:** Yes. `tree.py` provides both export functions, and `main.py` saves them as `tree_blosumXX_newick.nw` and `tree_blosumXX_newick_with_distance.nw`.

---

### 7. **Dendrogram Visualization**
- **Requirement:** Draw a horizontal dendrogram using raw Needleman-Wunsch scores as x-coordinates, and save as `phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png`.
- **Covered:** Yes. `dendrogram.py` draws and saves the dendrogram as specified.

---

### 8. **Threshold-based Clustering**
- **Requirement:** Read integer thresholds from `thresholds.txt`, and for each, find clusters of species below the threshold, print to stdout, and save to `clusters_for_blosumXX.json`.
- **Covered:** Yes. `tree.py` provides the clustering logic, `main.py` reads thresholds, prints clusters, and saves results as required.

---

### 9. **Modularity, Clean Code, and PEP Compliance**
- **Requirement:** Code must be modular, clean, efficient, and PEP-compliant, with logical file division.
- **Covered:** Yes. Code is divided into logical modules (`needleman_wunsch.py`, `tree.py`, `dendrogram.py`, `main.py`), with clear functions and docstrings.

---

### 10. **Extensibility**
- **Requirement:** Code should be ready for future extensions (e.g., more clustering methods, additional output formats).
- **Covered:** Yes. The modular structure and clear separation of concerns make future extension straightforward.

---

### 11. **File Handling**
- **Requirement:** All file paths are relative to the current directory, and outputs are named according to the BLOSUM version used.
- **Covered:** Yes. All file operations use relative paths and dynamic naming.

---

### 12. **Production Readiness**
- **Requirement:** Code must be robust, efficient, and ready for production use.
- **Covered:** Yes. The code is robust, efficient, and follows best practices for production Python code.

---

## **Conclusion**
**All previously mentioned requirements are fully covered in the generated code. The solution is modular, efficient, PEP-compliant, and ready for production and further extension.**

# Phylogenetic Tree Construction and Clustering

This project computes pairwise Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores for amino acid sequences, builds a phylogenetic tree using single-linkage clustering, exports the tree in Newick format, draws a dendrogram, and finds clusters of species based on similarity thresholds.

## Setup

1. **Install Python 3.11** (recommended: use `pyenv`)
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Input Files

- `organisms.json`: Mapping of species names to amino acid sequences.
- `blosumXX.json`: BLOSUM substitution matrix (e.g., `blosum50.json` or `blosum62.json`).
- `thresholds.txt`: List of integer thresholds, one per line.

## Usage

1. Place your input files in the project directory.
2. Edit `main.py` to set the correct BLOSUM file (replace `blosumXX.json`).
