## Prompt number 1

**User:** Hi, I'm a developer and I have a new project on my hands. I need to prepare a clustering algorithm for quite a specific input data. 
My input consists of DNA sequences for different species, for which I need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch scores between the two DNA strings according to the dictionary of swapping scores. This dictionary of costs is specified by "BLOSUM" matrix, which shows the cost of replacing one letter (of either, the nucleotide or amino acid alphabet) with another letter or a gap. Having the scores for all pairs I need to build phylogenetic tree of species and draw a dendrogram representing this tree. At the end, I need to be able to calculate clusters of species depending on different thresholds. 
I will need your help in programming this solution. This needs to be a production ready project, so I need to have clean and efficient code. Can you repeat what have you understand from this description, and prepare a short outline of the most important aspects, so we're on the same page? 


**LLM Response:**

Hi! This sounds like a fascinating and challenging project, combining bioinformatics with robust software engineering principles. I've carefully read your description, and here's my understanding and an outline of the most important aspects we need to consider to get this right.

---

### My Understanding of Your Project:

You are a developer tasked with building a production-ready solution for clustering DNA sequences from different species. The core steps involve:

1.  **Pairwise Sequence Scoring:** For every pair of DNA sequences, you need to calculate a Needleman-Wunsch (global alignment) score.
2.  **Custom Scoring Matrix:** This alignment will use a "BLOSUM" matrix to define the costs of nucleotide substitutions and gaps.
3.  **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:** Using these pairwise scores, you will build a phylogenetic tree representing the evolutionary relationships between the species.
4.  **Dendrogram Visualization:** The phylogenetic tree needs to be visualized as a dendrogram.
5.  **Threshold-Based Clustering:** Finally, you need to be able to extract clusters of species by applying different similarity/distance thresholds to the dendrogram.

You emphasize the need for **clean, efficient, and production-ready code**.

---

### Outline of Most Important Aspects:

To ensure we're on the same page and build a robust solution, here are the key aspects we'll focus on:

1.  **Clarification on BLOSUM Matrix for DNA:**
    *   **Critical Point:** BLOSUM matrices (e.g., BLOSUM62, BLOSUM50) are standard substitution matrices used for **amino acid** sequences (proteins), not typically for DNA (nucleotides). DNA sequences use different substitution models (e.g., identity matrix, PAM, Jukes-Cantor, Kimura 2-parameter).
    *   **Action Required:** We need to clarify if you indeed have a custom 4x4 (A, T, C, G) BLOSUM-like matrix for DNA, or if you meant a different type of nucleotide substitution matrix, or perhaps your "DNA sequences" are actually protein sequences derived from DNA. This is crucial for the correct implementation of Needleman-Wunsch. We'll also need to define specific **gap opening** and **gap extension penalties**, as these are separate from the substitution matrix.

2.  **Efficient Needleman-Wunsch Implementation:**
    *   **Algorithm:** We'll implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which is a dynamic programming approach.
    *   **Scoring Function:** This will incorporate the specified substitution matrix (once clarified) and gap penalties.
    *   **Pairwise Calculation:** For `N` species, we'll need to calculate `N * (N-1) / 2` unique pairwise scores. For a large number of species or very long sequences, this can be computationally intensive ($O(N^2 \cdot L_1 \cdot L_2)$ where L is sequence length).
    *   **Optimization:** We'll consider strategies for efficiency, such as using optimized libraries (e.g., Biopython's `pairwise2` or `Bio.Align`), potentially parallelizing the pairwise calculations for very large datasets, and ensuring memory efficiency.

3.  **Conversion of Scores to Distances:**
    *   **Similarity vs. Distance:** Needleman-Wunsch scores represent *similarity*. Phylogenetic tree construction algorithms (especially distance-based ones like UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining) typically require a *distance* matrix.
    *   **Transformation:** We'll need a clear strategy to convert similarity scores into a distance metric. Common approaches include:
        *   `distance = max_possible_score - actual_score`
        *   `distance = 1 - (normalized_score / max_possible_score)`
        *   `distance = 1 - (actual_score / score_of_self_alignment)`
    *   The choice of transformation can impact the tree topology, so we'll select one that makes biological sense for your data.

4.  **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:**
    *   **Method:** We'll likely use a distance-based method for tree construction, such as:
        *   **UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean):** A simpler method that assumes a constant rate of evolution.
        *   **Neighbor-Joining (NJ):** A more sophisticated method that does not assume a constant rate of evolution and often produces more accurate trees.
    *   **Libraries:** Biopython's `Bio.Phylo.TreeConstruction` module or SciPy's `cluster.hierarchy` will be invaluable here.

5.  **Dendrogram Visualization:**
    *   **Libraries:** We'll use `matplotlib` in conjunction with `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` to generate clear and customizable dendrograms.
    *   **Labeling:** Ensuring species names are correctly labeled on the dendrogram.
    *   **Customization:** Options for adjusting colors, line styles, and overall plot aesthetics for better readability.

6.  **Threshold-Based Clustering:**
    *   **Cutting the Dendrogram:** The dendrogram inherently represents hierarchical clusters. We can "cut" the dendrogram at different height (distance) thresholds to define distinct clusters of species.
    *   **Extraction:** We'll implement functionality to programmatically extract the species belonging to each cluster for a given threshold.
    *   **Output:** The output format for clusters (e.g., list of lists, dictionary) will be well-defined.

7.  **Production-Ready Code Principles:**
    *   **Modularity:** Breaking down the solution into logical functions and classes (e.g., `SequenceAligner`, `TreeBuilder`, `ClusterAnalyzer`).
    *   **Readability:** Clear variable names, comments, and consistent formatting.
    *   **Error Handling:** Robust handling of invalid inputs (e.g., non-DNA characters, empty sequences).
    *   **Configuration:** Externalizing parameters like gap penalties, substitution matrix path, and output paths.
    *   **Testing:** Implementing unit tests for core components (e.g., Needleman-Wunsch, distance conversion).
    *   **Documentation:** Clear docstrings for functions and classes.

---

This outline covers the technical and practical aspects. The most immediate next step is to **clarify the "BLOSUM matrix for DNA" point** and the specific gap penalties you intend to use. Once we have that, we can dive into the programming.

Does this align with your vision for the project?

## Prompt number 2

**User:** Thanks! Now, let's shortly align technical expectations. I need this program to be written in python 3.11, but you can choose necessary libraries freely. I will be using pyenv to create the environment and pip to install packages. If anything is saved to the file system or read from it, you should start all the paths from current directory and eventually use subfolders. I need my code to follow PEP formatting standards. When providing me a code samples or scritps, always include name of the file in which the code should be put. Could you please confirm specified limitations? Do not generate any code yet.

**LLM Response:**

Yes, I can absolutely confirm these technical expectations and limitations. They are clear and will guide the development process effectively.

Here's a summary of my confirmation:

1.  **Python Version:** I will ensure all code is compatible with and optimized for **Python 3.11**.
2.  **Library Choice:** I will freely choose and recommend the most suitable and efficient Python libraries (e.g., `Biopython`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`) for each task.
3.  **Environment Management:** I understand that you will be using `pyenv` for environment creation and `pip` for package installation. I will provide a `requirements.txt` file for easy setup.
4.  **File Paths:** All file system operations (reading/writing) will use **relative paths starting from the current directory**, utilizing subfolders as appropriate (e.g., `data/`, `output/`).
5.  **Code Formatting:** I will strictly adhere to **PEP 8 formatting standards** for clean, readable, and consistent code.
6.  **Code Samples/Scripts:** For every code snippet or script provided, I will **always include the suggested filename** where the code should be placed.

I confirm that I will not generate any code in this response, as per your instruction.

We are perfectly aligned on the technical setup.

## Prompt number 3

**User:** Great, let's start with the first task, which is calculation of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. As you probably know, it is an algorithm often used to align protein or nucleotide sequence - this is also what will be doing in our case. We have two input files. 
The first one is named "organisms.json" and it has a key-value structure with name of the species as a key, and its DNA string as a value, both key and value are of type string. Example structure of the "organism.json" file: ``` {"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"} ``` .
The second one is called “blosumXX.json”, where "XX" will be either 50 or 62 representing blosum50 and blosum62 matrices, respectively. It's also a file with a key-value structure based on BLOSUM table, which represents the substitution matrix used for sequence alignment. In the file, key is of type string and value is numerical. Exemplary file structure looks like: ```{“a”: -1, “b”: -2, “ab”: -3, “ba": -3, “aa”: 2, “bb”: 3} ```. A single character key represents the cost of deleting that character, while a key of two concatenated characters represents the cost of substituting one character for the other. Example above says that: deleting 'a' cost -1; deleting 'b' cost -2; swapping 'a' for 'b' or 'b' for 'a' cost -3; matching 'a' to 'a' scores +2; matching 'b' to 'b' scores +3.
In my project I will need to calculate the Needleman-Wunsch score of aligning two DNA sequences, for many pair of species. Also, I will be using two different types of BLOSUM tables: BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62. Created code can assume, that during one run only one type of blosum matrix will be used, but should be prepare to change the type of used matrix between different runs.
Could you please summarize information I have given you until now? Do not generate any code yet, just provide a summary of what you understand from the description. 


**LLM Response:**

Okay, I've got a clear understanding of the next set of requirements for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm implementation.

Here's a summary of the information you've provided:

1.  **Core Task:** Implement the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to calculate global alignment scores between pairs of DNA sequences.
2.  **Input Data - Organisms:**
    *   Species DNA sequences will be provided in a file named `organisms.json`.
    *   This file is a JSON dictionary where:
        *   Keys are `string` representing the species name.
        *   Values are `string` representing the DNA sequence for that species.
    *   Example: `{"Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL", "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT"}`.
3.  **Input Data - Scoring Matrix (BLOSUM-like):**
    *   The substitution and gap costs will be provided in a file named `blosumXX.json`, where `XX` will be either `50` or `62` (e.g., `blosum50.json`, `blosum62.json`).
    *   This file is a JSON dictionary where:
        *   Keys are `string` representing either a single character or a pair of characters.
        *   Values are `numerical` (integer or float) representing the associated cost/score.
    *   **Interpretation of Keys:**
        *   A **single character key** (e.g., `"a"`, `"b"`) represents the **cost of deleting/inserting (gap penalty)** that specific character. This implies that gap penalties can be character-specific, rather than a single global value.
        *   A **two-character key** (e.g., `"ab"`, `"ba"`, `"aa"`, `"bb"`) represents the **cost of substituting** the first character for the second. The example `{"ab": -3, "ba": -3}` confirms that substitution costs are symmetric.
    *   Example: `{"a": -1, "b": -2, "ab": -3, "ba": -3, "aa": 2, "bb": 3}`.
4.  **BLOSUM Matrix Usage:**
    *   The system needs to be prepared to use either `blosum50.json` or `blosum62.json`.
    *   However, during any single run of the program, only one specific BLOSUM matrix file will be active and used for all calculations.

This clarifies the exact structure of your input data and how the custom "BLOSUM" matrix will define both substitution and gap penalties for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This is a crucial detail, as it deviates from standard BLOSUM matrices (which are for amino acids and don't typically include gap penalties directly within the matrix structure in this way). We'll need to parse this matrix carefully to correctly apply the scores.

## Prompt number 4

**User:** Ok, now that you know what is the goal we can start coding. Please provide me a code that will read the data from both input files and for each pair of species from “organism.json” calculate a Needleman-Wunsch similarity score between their DNAs strings. Scores and penalties for matching and deleting should be assigned accordign to the data in “blosumXX.json” file. 
Exemplary test case for the created code: having one DNA string “aabaab” for key “testspecies1” and another DNA string “ababaa” for key “testspecies2”, with following data in the blosum.json file: {"a":-1, "b":-2, "ab":-3, "ba":-3, "aa":2, "bb":3}, the output of Needleman-Wunsch algorithm should be 7.
Keep in mind that this is only the first task of the project. These scores will be later used for other alorithms, like tree creation, so they should be stored in a structure with fast access.
You can create as many functions as needed for this task. Remember that the produced code should have production-ready quality.

### How to Run:

1.  **Save the files:**
    *   Save the `requirements.txt` content into a file named `requirements.txt` in your project root.
    *   Create a folder named `src` in your project root.
    *   Save the `src/utils.py` content into `src/utils.py`.
    *   Save the `src/aligner.py` content into `src/aligner.py`.
    *   Save the `main.py` content into `main.py` in your project root.
2.  **Set up the environment (using `pyenv` and `pip` as you specified):**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your project root directory
    cd /path/to/your/project_root

    # Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment
    pyenv install 3.11.9 # Or your preferred 3.11.x version
    pyenv virtualenv 3.11.9 dna-clustering-env

    # Activate the environment
    pyenv activate dna-clustering-env

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Explanation and Production-Ready Aspects:

1.  **Modularity (`src/` directory):**
    *   `utils.py`: Contains generic utility functions (like `load_json_data`) that can be reused across different parts of the project.
    *   `aligner.py`: Encapsulates the `NeedlemanWunschAligner` class, which handles all logic related to the BLOSUM matrix parsing and the alignment algorithm itself. This separation makes the code easier to test, maintain, and understand.
    *   `main.py`: Orchestrates the overall flow, loading data, calling the aligner, and presenting results. It also includes the example usage and dummy data creation.

2.  **`NeedlemanWunschAligner` Class:**
    *   **Initialization (`__init__`):** Loads and parses the BLOSUM matrix only once when the aligner is created. This is efficient if you're performing many alignments with the same matrix.
    *   **Matrix Parsing (`_load_and_parse_blosum_matrix`):**
        *   It correctly distinguishes between single-character keys (gap penalties) and two-character keys (substitution scores).
        *   It normalizes characters to uppercase to handle potential case inconsistencies in input data.
        *   It builds an `_alphabet` set to quickly check if characters in DNA sequences are supported by the matrix.
        *   Includes robust `ValueError` checks for invalid matrix formats or missing essential entries (like gap penalties).
    *   **Helper Methods (`_get_score`, `_get_gap_penalty`):** Provide clear interfaces for retrieving scores and penalties, centralizing the lookup logic and error handling for undefined characters/scores.
    *   **Alignment (`align`):**
        *   Uses `numpy.zeros` for efficient creation and manipulation of the dynamic programming matrix.
        *   Initializes the first row and column correctly with cumulative gap penalties.
        *   The core dynamic programming loop correctly calculates `match`, `delete`, and `insert` options and takes the maximum.
        *   Handles empty sequences gracefully by returning cumulative gap penalties.

3.  **Data Structures for Scores:**
    *   The `calculate_pairwise_alignment_scores` function returns a `Dict[str, Dict[str, int]]` (implemented using `defaultdict(dict)`). This structure allows for fast access to `scores[species1][species2]` and naturally handles string keys (species names).
    *   Scores are stored symmetrically (`scores[A][B] = scores[B][A]`) to ensure consistent access regardless of the order of species names.

4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   `src/utils.py`: Catches `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, and general `Exception` during file loading.
    *   `src/aligner.py`: Raises `ValueError` for invalid BLOSUM matrix formats, missing scores/penalties, or unsupported characters in DNA sequences.
    *   `main.py`: Uses a `try-except` block to catch potential errors from the utility and aligner classes, providing informative messages to the user.

5.  **PEP 8 and Readability:**
    *   Consistent naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes).
    *   Clear docstrings for all functions and classes, explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
    *   Type hints are used extensively for better code clarity and maintainability.
    *   Logical separation of concerns.

6.  **File Paths:**
    *   All file paths are constructed using `os.path.join` and `os.path.dirname(__file__)` to ensure they are relative to the script's location, making the project portable.
    *   Input files are expected in a `data/` subfolder.

7.  **Test Case:**
    *   The `main.py` includes the exact test case you provided (`aabaab` vs `ababaa` with the specific BLOSUM example) and verifies its output. This is a crucial step for production-ready code.
    *   It also demonstrates how to switch between different BLOSUM matrices (`BLOSUM50_FILE` vs `BLOSUM62_FILE`) by simply changing the argument passed to the `calculate_pairwise_alignment_scores` function.

This setup provides a solid foundation for your project, ready for the next steps of phylogenetic tree construction and clustering.

## Prompt number 5

**User:** Thanks! Now I would need one modification to this code. Beside having Needleman-Wunsch scores calculated and stored inside the code, I also need to have them saved on the file system. Please add a modification that allows saving the calculated scores in a json file. The file should represent a key-value structure, where keys are created by concatenating names of the species in the pair using “_”, while value should be the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result. 
As I mentioned previously, this should be albe to execute using two different "blosumXX.json" files on input. Respectively to which file is used, save the results to file called "organisms_scores_bloumXX.json".
Still keep in mind that this is only intermediate step, not a final solution yet.  


**LLM Response:**

Understood! We'll add a new function to save the calculated pairwise scores to a JSON file, dynamically naming the output file based on the BLOSUM matrix used.

Here's how we'll modify the existing `main.py` and potentially add a new utility function if needed (though `utils.py` already has `load_json_data`, we might add a `save_json_data` there).

### Key Changes and Why:

1.  **`src/utils.py` Modification:**
    *   Added `save_json_data(data: Dict[str, Any], filepath: str) -> None`: This new utility function handles the generic task of saving a dictionary to a JSON file. It also ensures the output directory exists using `os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(filepath), exist_ok=True)`. This keeps the file saving logic centralized and reusable.

2.  **`main.py` Modifications:**
    *   **`OUTPUT_DIR` Constant:** A new constant `OUTPUT_DIR` is defined, pointing to the `output/` subfolder.
    *   **`prepare_and_save_scores` Function:**
        *   This new function takes the `pairwise_scores` (the nested dictionary), the `blosum_matrix_filepath` (to derive the output filename), and the `output_dir`.
        *   It iterates through the `pairwise_scores` and creates a *flat* dictionary where keys are `species1_species2` and values are the scores.
        *   **Important:** It uses `if species1 <= species2:` to ensure that each unique pair is stored only once (e.g., `A_B` but not `B_A`), and also includes self-alignments (`A_A`). This keeps the output file clean and non-redundant.
        *   **Dynamic Filename:** It uses `re.search(r'blosum(\d+)\.json$', blosum_matrix_filepath)` to extract the `XX` (e.g., "50" or "62") from the BLOSUM matrix filename. This `XX` is then used to construct the output filename `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`.
        *   It calls the new `save_json_data` utility to perform the actual file writing.
    *   **Integration in `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:**
        *   After `calculate_pairwise_alignment_scores` is called, `prepare_and_save_scores` is immediately called to save the results.
        *   The dummy data creation now also ensures the `output/` directory exists.
        *   An example run with `BLOSUM62_FILE` is added to demonstrate the dynamic filename generation.
    *   **Error Handling:** The `try-except` block in `main.py` is updated to also catch `IOError` which `save_json_data` might raise.

Now, when you run `python main.py`, it will not only print the scores but also create JSON files like `output/organisms_scores_blosum_example.json`, `output/organisms_scores_blosum50.json`, and `output/organisms_scores_blosum62.json` (if all examples are run) with the specified key-value structure.

## Prompt number 6

**User:** Great, thanks! Now it's time for the second task of the project. We can use calculated Needleman-Wunsch similarity score as a proxy for overall siilarity between species and use them to build a "tree of file" from the bottom up. 
In this context, the tree will show branching in evolutionary history, and it is known as a Phylogenetic tree. To build it, we'll merge nodes together first that have the highest similarity score (highest Needleman-Wunsch algorithm result), and they will end up towards the bottom of the tree. Internal nodes can then be thought of as common ancestors, and eventually we will end up at a root which can be thought of as the origin of life.
This is a similar task to performing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering. For this case the linkage method should be single-linkage clustering, with the distance metric equal to needleman-wunsch algorithm results.
While for hierarhical clustering the results are usually only presented in form of dendgrogram, for this task I will need results both in visual form as well as written in text Newick format. Also, in later steps I will need to generate clusters of species for different threshold. Those thresholds will be chosen difectly from the range of Needleman-Wunsch scores saved in "organisms_Scores_blosumXX.json" file - for example if the scores in this file ranhe grom 800 to 1000, thresholds in "thresholds.txt" file can be 850, 910, 980. Be aware to prepare for those task, while creating a tree structure.
That's an overall view of the next tasks, do not generate a code for with solution yet. For now please summarize what is the outline of this project, so we're on the same page.  


**LLM Response:**

Okay, I've thoroughly reviewed your description for the second phase of the project. This is a classic application of hierarchical clustering in bioinformatics, and I'm clear on the objectives.

Here's my summary and outline of the most important aspects for building the phylogenetic tree:

---

### My Understanding of Your Project (Phase 2: Phylogenetic Tree Construction):

You need to build a **phylogenetic tree** (specifically, a "tree of life" from the bottom up) using the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores calculated in the previous step. This process is analogous to **agglomerative hierarchical clustering**.

Key requirements:

1.  **Input:** The pairwise Needleman-Wunsch *similarity* scores (from `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`).
2.  **Clustering Algorithm:** Agglomerative hierarchical clustering.
3.  **Linkage Method:** **Single-linkage clustering**. This means that when merging two clusters, the distance between them is defined as the *minimum* distance between any two members from the respective clusters.
4.  **Distance Metric:** This is crucial. You stated "distance metric equal to needleman-wunsch algorithm results". Since Needleman-Wunsch scores are *similarity* (higher score = more similar), and clustering algorithms typically operate on *distances* (lower value = more similar), we will need to **transform the similarity scores into a distance metric**. The goal is to merge species with the *highest similarity* first, which translates to merging clusters with the *smallest distance* first.
5.  **Output Formats:**
    *   **Visual:** A **dendrogram** representing the hierarchical tree.
    *   **Textual:** The tree structure in **Newick format**.
6.  **Future Clustering Preparation:** The tree structure must be suitable for later extracting clusters based on specific **Needleman-Wunsch score thresholds**. This implies that the "height" or "distance" axis of the dendrogram should be directly relatable back to the original similarity scores.

---

### Outline of Most Important Aspects (Phase 2):

1.  **Loading Pairwise Similarity Scores:**
    *   We'll load the `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` file, which contains the Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores in the `species1_species2: score` format.

2.  **Similarity to Distance Transformation (CRITICAL STEP):**
    *   As discussed, Needleman-Wunsch scores are similarities. For agglomerative clustering, we need distances.
    *   **Proposed Transformation:** `distance = Max_Score - Actual_Score`.
        *   `Max_Score` will be the maximum possible Needleman-Wunsch score observed in the dataset (e.g., the highest self-alignment score, or the global maximum if sequences are very similar). This ensures that higher similarity scores map to smaller distances, and identical sequences (highest similarity) map to a distance of 0 (or close to it).
        *   This transformation is ideal because it directly relates the dendrogram's height (distance) back to the original Needleman-Wunsch similarity scale. If a dendrogram is cut at a distance `D`, this corresponds to a similarity threshold `Max_Score - D`.
    *   We will convert the flat score dictionary into a square distance matrix (or a condensed distance vector, as required by `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`).

3.  **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering Implementation:**
    *   **Library:** We will leverage `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` for its robust implementation of hierarchical clustering.
    *   **Input:** The distance matrix (or condensed distance vector) derived from the Needleman-Wunsch scores.
    *   **Method:** Explicitly use `method='single'` for single-linkage clustering.
    *   **Output:** The `linkage` function will return a linkage matrix, which is the core representation of the hierarchical tree.

4.  **Dendrogram Visualization:**
    *   **Library:** `matplotlib.pyplot` in conjunction with `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram`.
    *   **Customization:** We'll ensure clear labeling of species names at the leaves. We'll also need to consider how to display the distance axis in a way that is intuitive and potentially relates back to the original similarity scores.

5.  **Newick Format Generation:**
    *   **Library:** `Biopython.Phylo` is excellent for handling phylogenetic trees and converting them to Newick format. We'll need to convert the `scipy` linkage matrix into a `Bio.Phylo.Tree` object.
    *   **Output:** The Newick string will be saved to a text file.

6.  **Preparation for Threshold-Based Clustering:**
    *   The `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram` and `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster` functions operate directly on the linkage matrix and a specified distance threshold.
    *   By using the `Max_Score - Actual_Score` transformation, we can easily map a desired Needleman-Wunsch similarity threshold `T_sim` to a corresponding distance threshold `T_dist = Max_Score - T_sim` for cutting the dendrogram. This will allow us to extract clusters based on the original similarity values.

This plan addresses all your requirements, including the crucial similarity-to-distance conversion and the preparation for future threshold-based clustering. We're ready to proceed with coding this phase.

## Prompt number 7

**User:** OK, now that we have a common understanding let's start coding this solution. The first step is to create a tree structure that will represent the history of evolution of species. The tree should be created with a single-linage clustering method, using Neeldeman-Wush similarity scores as distance metric. 
It starts with having every organism from the keys of 'organisms.json' file as a separate entity. Next, based on the similarity scores calculated using Needleman-Wunsch approach, we merge them in twos starting from the most similar ones (higher needleman-wunsch score = more similar). 
During each merge new intermediate node is created, and it shoul have Neeldeman-Wunsch score assigned to it. The tree build should result in creation of one final root node, that will represent common ancestor to all species. 
Please prepare a code that implements such a flow. The choices of libraries and structure are up to you, but rememer that next tasks will include drawing dendrogram of this tree and saving it to text Newick format. Also, keep in mind that the produced code should have production-ready quality.


**LLM Response:**

Okay, this is a clear and well-defined next step. Building the phylogenetic tree using hierarchical clustering is central to your project. We'll implement this using `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` and ensure the output is suitable for both visualization (dendrogram) and Newick format conversion, while also keeping track of the similarity-to-distance transformation for future thresholding.

### How to Run:

1.  **Update `requirements.txt`**: Add `scipy==1.12.0` (or a compatible version).
2.  **Install/Update Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Activate your pyenv environment if not already active
    pyenv activate dna-clustering-env
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Save the new file**: Save the `src/tree_builder.py` content into `src/tree_builder.py`.
4.  **Update existing files**: Replace the content of `src/utils.py` and `main.py` with the updated code provided above.
5.  **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Explanation and Production-Ready Aspects:

1.  **`src/tree_builder.py` - `PhylogeneticTreeBuilder` Class:**
    *   **Encapsulation:** All logic for loading scores, transforming them, and performing clustering is encapsulated within this class.
    *   **`_load_and_prepare_distances` Method:**
        *   Loads the flat `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` file.
        *   **Species Labeling:** Extracts all unique species names and sorts them. This sorted list (`self._species_labels`) is crucial because `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` functions (like `linkage` and `dendrogram`) refer to the original observations by their index in this sorted list.
        *   **`Max_Score` Determination:** It dynamically calculates `self._max_similarity_score` by finding the maximum value among all loaded similarity scores. This is the `Max_Score` used in the `Max_Score - Actual_Score` transformation.
        *   **Similarity to Distance Transformation:** For each `species1_species2` pair, it calculates `distance = self._max_similarity_score - similarity_score`. This correctly maps higher similarities to lower distances, fulfilling the requirement to merge most similar species first.
        *   **Condensed Distance Vector:** It constructs a square distance matrix and then converts it to a condensed distance vector using `scipy.spatial.distance.squareform`. This is the most memory-efficient and standard input format for `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage`.
    *   **`build_tree` Method:**
        *   Calls `_load_and_prepare_distances` to get the prepared input.
        *   Executes `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage(condensed_distances, method='single')`. The `method='single'` explicitly tells SciPy to use single-linkage clustering.
        *   Returns the `linkage_matrix` (Z), the `species_labels` (ordered list of original species), and `max_similarity_score`. These three pieces of information are all that's needed for the next steps (dendrogram and Newick, and thresholding).

2.  **`main.py` Integration:**
    *   The `prepare_and_save_scores` function now returns the `filepath` of the saved scores, which is then passed directly to the `PhylogeneticTreeBuilder`. This makes the workflow more robust and less prone to errors from hardcoded paths.
    *   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block now demonstrates:
        *   The full flow: calculate scores -> save scores -> load saved scores -> build tree.
        *   How to build trees for different BLOSUM matrices (BLOSUM50 and BLOSUM62).
        *   Prints the resulting `linkage_matrix`, `species_labels`, and `max_similarity_score` for inspection.

3.  **Production-Ready Considerations:**
    *   **Modularity:** Clear separation of concerns into `aligner.py`, `utils.py`, and `tree_builder.py`.
    *   **Error Handling:** Robust checks for empty/malformed input files and invalid data types.
    *   **Clarity:** Type hints, docstrings, and meaningful variable names are used throughout.
    *   **Efficiency:** Using `numpy` for matrix operations and `scipy.spatial.distance.squareform` for condensed distance vectors is efficient for clustering.
    *   **Future-Proofing:** By returning `max_similarity_score` along with the linkage matrix, we've explicitly prepared for the threshold-based clustering requirement. The "distance" in the linkage matrix can be converted back to the original "similarity" using `similarity = max_similarity_score - distance`.

This setup provides the core hierarchical clustering logic, ready for visualization and Newick format conversion.

## Prompt number 8

**User:** Great, since we now have a tree structure, let's save it to a Newick format. 
I will need a code that saves tree representation to two different versions of Newick format: 
first one that saves only nodes' names, for example: "(A,B,(C,D)E)F;" - this should be saved to a "treeXX_newick.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks; 
second one should save both nodes' names and distances in the tree, for example: "(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F;" - this should be saved to a "treeXX_newick_with_distance.nw", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
Please modify previously generated code to include this requirenment. 


**LLM Response:**

Okay, this is a great next step! Generating the Newick format is essential for interoperability and further analysis, and `Biopython` is the perfect tool for this. We'll create a new module specifically for tree export.

### How to Run:

1.  **Update `requirements.txt`**: Add `biopython==1.83` (or a compatible version).
2.  **Install/Update Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Activate your pyenv environment if not already active
    pyenv activate dna-clustering-env
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Save the new file**: Save the `src/tree_exporter.py` content into `src/tree_exporter.py`.
4.  **Update existing files**: Replace the content of `main.py` with the updated code provided above. (No changes to `src/utils.py` or `src/aligner.py` for this step).
5.  **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

After running, you will find the Newick files (e.g., `tree50_newick.nw`, `tree50_newick_with_distance.nw`, etc.) in your `output/` directory.

### Explanation and Production-Ready Aspects:

1.  **`src/tree_exporter.py` - `TreeExporter` Class:**
    *   **Dedicated Responsibility:** This new class is solely responsible for handling the conversion of the `scipy` linkage matrix into `Biopython` tree objects and then writing them to Newick files. This keeps the concerns separated.
    *   **`export_to_newick` Method:**
        *   Takes the `linkage_matrix`, `species_labels`, and `blosum_matrix_filepath` as input. The `blosum_matrix_filepath` is used to dynamically generate the output filenames (`treeXX_newick.nw` and `treeXX_newick_with_distance.nw`).
        *   **Tree with Distances:** `Bio.Phylo.from_linkage(linkage_matrix, species_labels)` directly creates a `Biopython` tree where the branch lengths are the distances from the linkage matrix. This is exactly what's needed for the `_with_distance.nw` file.
        *   **Tree without Distances:** To achieve the "no distances" format, a *separate* tree object is created. Then, a loop iterates through all clades (nodes and leaves) in this tree and explicitly sets `clade.branch_length = None`. When `Biopython` writes a Newick string, it omits branch lengths for clades where `branch_length` is `None`.
        *   **File Saving:** `Bio.Phylo.write()` is used to save the tree objects to the specified Newick files.
        *   **Output Directory Handling:** The `__init__` method ensures the `output_dir` exists.

2.  **`main.py` Integration:**
    *   An instance of `TreeExporter` is created.
    *   After the phylogenetic trees are built (resulting in `linkage_matrix_50`, `species_labels_50`, etc.), the `tree_exporter.export_to_newick` method is called for each BLOSUM version.
    *   The `blosum_matrix_filepath` is passed to `export_to_newick` to ensure the correct `XX` is used in the output filename.

3.  **Production-Ready Considerations:**
    *   **Modularity:** Further enhances the modularity by isolating tree export logic.
    *   **Clarity:** The use of `Bio.Phylo` makes the tree manipulation and export straightforward and standard.
    *   **Correctness:** The `Max_Score - Actual_Score` transformation in `tree_builder.py` ensures that the distances used as branch lengths in the Newick format correctly reflect the original similarity, where smaller distances mean higher similarity.
    *   **Robustness:** Error handling for file paths and BLOSUM version extraction is maintained.

This completes the Newick export requirement, providing both formats you requested.

## Prompt number 9

**User:** Thanks! I also need to have a visual representation of created tree structure. Please prepare a code that draw a dendrogram of this tree and saves it to png file named "phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks.
You can draw this dendrogram in any style you want, the only requirement is that it sould be lay out horizontally, and the x coordinates should be determined by the raw Needleman-Wunsch distances. 


**LLM Response:**



## Prompt number 10

**User:** Awesome, we're almost at the finish. The last task is to find out which species create clusters together based on specific threshold.
There is an additional input file called "thresholds.txt", inside which in each line only one value is written, for example 1260. 
Each value in this file, represents a threshold for clustering where we can say that everything in the tree above this threshold is forgot and we check which leaf nodes still end up connected. Those conenctions forms clusters of leaf nodes, which I need this program to find out. 
As I previously mentioned, the range of threshold values will be from the same range as raw Needleman-Wunsch distances calculated ealier.
This is a description of the last task to preform, please do not generate a code for it yet. Provide a summary with your understanding of this task.


**LLM Response:**

Okay, I've got a clear understanding of both the dendrogram visualization requirement and the final threshold-based clustering task.

First, let's summarize the dendrogram visualization. Then, as requested, I will provide a separate summary for the threshold-based clustering task without generating any code for it yet.

---

### My Understanding of Your Project (Dendrogram Visualization):

You need to generate a visual representation of the phylogenetic tree in the form of a **dendrogram**.

*   **Input:** The `linkage_matrix`, the ordered `species_labels`, and the `max_similarity_score` (which helps in understanding the distance scale) obtained from the `PhylogeneticTreeBuilder`.
*   **Output:** A PNG image file named `phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png` (where `XX` is the BLOSUM version) saved in the `output/` directory.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   The dendrogram must be laid out **horizontally**.
    *   The **x-axis** of the dendrogram must represent the **raw Needleman-Wunsch distances**. These are the distances calculated as `Max_Score - Actual_Score` that were used to build the tree. This means the distances from the `linkage_matrix` should be directly plotted on the x-axis.
    *   The style is flexible, but it should be clear and readable.

---

### My Understanding of Your Project (Phase 3: Threshold-Based Clustering - **No Code Yet**):

You need to identify and extract clusters of species from the previously built phylogenetic tree based on a set of user-defined similarity thresholds.

**Input:**

1.  **Phylogenetic Tree Data:** The `linkage_matrix`, the ordered `species_labels`, and the `max_similarity_score` (used for distance transformation) obtained from the `PhylogeneticTreeBuilder`.
2.  **Thresholds File:** A new input file named `thresholds.txt`.
    *   This file contains one numerical value per line.
    *   **Crucially, these values represent *Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores*** (e.g., 850, 910, 980).

**Core Task:**

For each similarity threshold `T_sim` provided in `thresholds.txt`, determine which species form distinct clusters.

*   **Clustering Logic:** The clustering is performed by "cutting" the hierarchical tree (dendrogram) at a specific point.
    *   Species that remain connected *below* this cut point (i.e., merged at a similarity score *equal to or higher than* the threshold) belong to the same cluster.
    *   Species that merge at a similarity score *lower than* the threshold (meaning their distance is *higher* than the corresponding distance threshold) will be in different clusters.
*   **Similarity-to-Distance Conversion:** Since the clustering algorithm (and the dendrogram's axis) operates on *distances* (where lower distance means higher similarity), each input similarity threshold `T_sim` must be converted to a corresponding distance threshold `T_dist`.
    *   The conversion formula will be: `T_dist = Max_Similarity_Score - T_sim`.
    *   This `T_dist` will then be used to cut the dendrogram.

**Output:**

*   For each threshold from `thresholds.txt`, the program should output the identified clusters.
*   The output format should clearly list the species belonging to each cluster for a given threshold (e.g., a dictionary mapping threshold to a list of lists of species names, or a structured printout to console/file).

**Key Considerations for Implementation:**

*   **`scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster`:** This function is perfectly suited for this task. It takes the linkage matrix and a distance threshold (`T_dist`) and returns an array of cluster assignments for each original observation (species).
*   **Mapping Cluster IDs to Species Names:** The output of `fcluster` will be numerical cluster IDs. We'll need to map these back to the original `species_labels` to present meaningful clusters.
*   **Handling `thresholds.txt`:** A new utility function will be needed to read and parse this file.
*   **Robustness:** Ensure proper error handling for `thresholds.txt` (e.g., non-numeric values, empty file).

---

This summary confirms my understanding of the dendrogram visualization and the upcoming threshold-based clustering task. I'm ready to proceed with coding the dendrogram visualization next.

## Prompt number 11

**User:** Great, so now let's create this last piece of code. I need you to add to the code, a modification that will read thresholds from "thresholds.txt" file, and for each of them calculate clusters of leaf nodes with names of species. Clusters should be stored as a list of lists, where each inner list represent one cluster.
Print those results to standard output, but also save them to json file called "clusters_for_blosumXX.json", where XX represents version of blosum table that was used throught previous tasks. The file should store data in a key-value format, where key represents a threshold used and value is a list of lists representing created clusters.
Remember that the produced code should have production-ready quality.


**LLM Response:**

Alright, this is the final stretch! We'll add the dendrogram visualization and the threshold-based clustering logic, ensuring everything is production-ready and follows the specified output formats.

### How to Run:

1.  **Update `requirements.txt`**: Add `matplotlib==3.8.3` (or a compatible version).
2.  **Install/Update Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    # Activate your pyenv environment if not already active
    pyenv activate dna-clustering-env
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Save the new files**:
    *   Save the `src/visualizer.py` content into `src/visualizer.py`.
    *   Save the `src/cluster_analyzer.py` content into `src/cluster_analyzer.py`.
4.  **Update existing files**: Replace the content of `main.py` with the updated code provided above. (No changes to `src/utils.py`, `src/aligner.py`, `src/tree_builder.py`, `src/tree_exporter.py` for this step).
5.  **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

After running, you will find:
*   PNG dendrograms (e.g., `phylogenetic_tree_blosum50.png`) in your `output/` directory.
*   JSON files with clusters (e.g., `clusters_for_blosum50.json`) in your `output/` directory.
*   The cluster results will also be printed to the console.

### Explanation and Production-Ready Aspects:

1.  **`src/visualizer.py` - `DendrogramVisualizer` Class:**
    *   **Dedicated Responsibility:** Handles only the dendrogram plotting.
    *   **`draw_and_save_dendrogram` Method:**
        *   Takes the `linkage_matrix`, `species_labels`, `blosum_matrix_filepath` (for naming), and `max_similarity_score` (for axis labeling context).
        *   Uses `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting.
        *   `plt.figure(figsize=...)` dynamically adjusts the plot height based on the number of species for better readability.
        *   `orientation='right'` ensures the dendrogram is horizontal.
        *   `plt.xlabel("Needleman-Wunsch Distance")` explicitly labels the x-axis as requested. The values on this axis are directly from the linkage matrix, which are `Max_Score - Actual_Score`.
        *   `plt.tight_layout()` helps prevent labels from overlapping.
        *   `plt.savefig()` saves the plot as a PNG.
        *   `plt.close()` is crucial for production code to prevent plots from accumulating in memory, especially when running in a loop or as part of a larger script.

2.  **`src/cluster_analyzer.py` - `ClusterAnalyzer` Class:**
    *   **Dedicated Responsibility:** Manages loading thresholds, finding clusters, and saving/printing results.
    *   **`_load_thresholds` Method:**
        *   Reads `thresholds.txt` line by line.
        *   Includes robust error handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError` (for non-numeric thresholds).
        *   Converts thresholds to `float` and removes duplicates, then sorts them (descending for consistent output presentation).
    *   **`find_and_save_clusters` Method:**
        *   Iterates through each `sim_threshold` loaded from the file.
        *   **Crucial Transformation:** `dist_threshold = max_similarity_score - sim_threshold`. This correctly converts the user-provided *similarity* threshold into the *distance* threshold required by `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fcluster`.
        *   `fcluster(linkage_matrix, dist_threshold, criterion='distance')` performs the actual clustering. `criterion='distance'` tells `fcluster` to cut the tree where the distance between merged clusters exceeds `dist_threshold`.
        *   The raw cluster assignments (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 3]`) are then mapped back to meaningful species names using `defaultdict(list)` and `species_labels`.
        *   The resulting clusters are sorted (`sorted([sorted(members) for members in clusters_by_id.values()])`) for consistent, reproducible output.
        *   Results are stored in a dictionary `all_clusters_data` keyed by the similarity threshold.
        *   The clusters are printed to standard output for immediate feedback.
        *   `save_json_data` (from `src/utils.py`) is used to save the `all_clusters_data` to the `clusters_for_blosumXX.json` file.

3.  **`main.py` Integration:**
    *   New instances of `DendrogramVisualizer` and `ClusterAnalyzer` are created.
    *   The `main` block now orchestrates the entire pipeline:
        1.  Calculate and save Needleman-Wunsch scores.
        2.  Build phylogenetic trees (get linkage matrix, labels, max similarity).
        3.  Export trees to Newick format.
        4.  Draw and save dendrograms.
        5.  Find and save clusters based on thresholds.
    *   All necessary parameters (`linkage_matrix`, `species_labels`, `max_similarity_score`, `blosum_matrix_filepath`, `THRESHOLDS_FILE`, `OUTPUT_DIR`) are passed to the respective functions.
    *   Dummy data for `thresholds.txt` is created for easy testing.

This completes all the requirements for your project, providing a clean, modular, efficient, and production-ready solution for DNA sequence clustering, phylogenetic tree construction, visualization, and threshold-based cluster extraction.

## Prompt number 12

**User:** This was the end of coding tasks for this project. Right now all functionalities should be covered. The final code should start with reading input “blosumXX.json” and “organism.json” files and at the end print clusters for thresholds from the "thresholds.txt" file to the standard output. Additionally, saving intermediate outputs as previously mentioned. This will be considered as a successful implementation. Remember that implemented solutions must be of high quality. Please check if all of this is covered.

**LLM Response:**

Yes, I can absolutely confirm that all functionalities you've described are now covered in the provided code, and the overall structure and flow meet your requirements for a production-ready solution.

Let's break down the confirmation based on your final summary:

1.  **Starting with Input Files (`blosumXX.json` and `organisms.json`):**
    *   The `main.py` script initiates the process by defining the paths to `organisms.json` and the various `blosumXX.json` files (including `blosum50.json`, `blosum62.json`, and `blosum_example.json`).
    *   The `calculate_pairwise_alignment_scores` function, which is the first major step, explicitly loads data from `organisms.json` and the chosen `blosum_matrix_filepath` using the robust `load_json_data` utility.
    *   **Confirmed.**

2.  **Printing Clusters to Standard Output:**
    *   The `ClusterAnalyzer` class, specifically its `find_and_save_clusters` method, is responsible for this.
    *   After calculating the clusters for each threshold, it iterates through them and prints them to the console in a clear, readable format.
    *   **Confirmed.**

3.  **Saving Intermediate Outputs:**
    *   **Needleman-Wunsch Scores:** The `prepare_and_save_scores` function saves the calculated pairwise scores to `organisms_scores_blosumXX.json` files in the `output/` directory.
    *   **Newick Tree Formats:** The `TreeExporter` class, via its `export_to_newick` method, saves two versions of the phylogenetic tree: `treeXX_newick.nw` (names only) and `treeXX_newick_with_distance.nw` (names and distances) in the `output/` directory.
    *   **Dendrograms:** The `DendrogramVisualizer` class, via its `draw_and_save_dendrogram` method, saves the horizontal dendrograms to `phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png` files in the `output/` directory, with the x-axis representing Needleman-Wunsch distances.
    *   **Clusters:** The `ClusterAnalyzer` class, via its `find_and_save_clusters` method, saves the identified clusters for each threshold to `clusters_for_blosumXX.json` files in the `output/` directory, with the specified key-value structure.
    *   **Confirmed.**

4.  **High-Quality, Production-Ready Code:**
    *   **Modularity:** The solution is highly modular, with clear separation of concerns into dedicated classes and files (`aligner.py`, `tree_builder.py`, `tree_exporter.py`, `visualizer.py`, `cluster_analyzer.py`, `utils.py`). This enhances maintainability, testability, and readability.
    *   **Readability & Maintainability:** Extensive use of type hints, clear docstrings for all classes and methods, meaningful variable names, and consistent PEP 8 formatting.
    *   **Robustness & Error Handling:** Comprehensive `try-except` blocks are used throughout `main.py` and within individual modules to gracefully handle common issues like `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, `ValueError` (for malformed data or invalid parameters), and general `IOError`.
    *   **Efficiency:** Leverages optimized libraries like `NumPy` and `SciPy` for numerical computations and clustering, and `Biopython` for bioinformatics-specific tasks. `matplotlib.pyplot.close()` is used to prevent memory leaks from plots.
    *   **Configuration:** File paths are handled robustly using `os.path.join` and relative paths, making the project portable.
    *   **Testability:** The modular design makes individual components easier to unit test. The `main.py` includes dummy data generation and a specific test case verification for the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
    *   **Confirmed.**

In summary, the entire pipeline, from initial data loading and pairwise alignment to phylogenetic tree construction, visualization, Newick export, and final threshold-based clustering with output to console and files, is fully implemented according to your specifications.

# DNA Sequence Phylogenetic Clustering

This project implements a solution for clustering DNA sequences from different species, building a phylogenetic tree, and identifying species clusters based on user-defined similarity thresholds. It leverages the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment and hierarchical clustering for tree construction.

## Features

*   **Needleman-Wunsch Alignment:** Calculates global alignment scores between DNA sequences using a custom BLOSUM-like substitution matrix and character-specific gap penalties.
*   **Pairwise Score Storage:** Stores all calculated pairwise similarity scores in a structured JSON file.
*   **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:** Builds a phylogenetic tree using agglomerative single-linkage hierarchical clustering, where Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores are transformed into a distance metric.
*   **Newick Export:** Exports the constructed phylogenetic tree into two Newick formats: one with only node names and another including branch lengths (distances).
*   **Dendrogram Visualization:** Generates a horizontal dendrogram visualization of the tree, with the x-axis representing Needleman-Wunsch distances, and saves it as a PNG image.
*   **Threshold-Based Clustering:** Identifies and extracts clusters of species by applying user-defined Needleman-Wunsch similarity thresholds to the phylogenetic tree.
*   **Production-Ready Code:** Emphasizes modularity, readability, robust error handling, and efficient use of libraries.

    *   A JSON file mapping species names to their DNA sequences.
    *   **Format:** `{"SpeciesName1": "DNA_Sequence1", "SpeciesName2": "DNA_Sequence2", ...}`
    *   *Example (dummy data created by `main.py`):*
        ```json
        {
            "Wild boar": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL",
            "Horse": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMT",
            "Dog": "MTHQTHAYHMVNPSPWPLTGALSALLMTSGL",

        }
        ```

*   **`blosumXX.json`** (e.g., `blosum50.json`, `blosum62.json`, `blosum_example.json`):
    *   A JSON file defining substitution scores and gap penalties.
    *   **Format:**
        *   Single-character keys (e.g., `"A"`, `"T"`) represent the cost of deleting/inserting that character (gap penalty).
        *   Two-character keys (e.g., `"AT"`, `"AA"`) represent the cost of substituting the first character for the second.
    *   *Example (dummy data created by `main.py`):*
        ```json
        {
            "A": -1, "C": -1, "G": -1, "T": -1,
            "AA": 10, "CC": 10, "GG": 10, "TT": 10,
            "AC": -5, "CA": -5, "AG": -5, "GA": -5,
            "AT": -5, "TA": -5, "CG": -5, "GC": -5,
            "CT": -5, "TC": -5
        }
        ```

*   **`thresholds.txt`**:
    *   A plain text file with one numerical Needleman-Wunsch similarity threshold per line.
    *   *Example (dummy data created by `main.py`):*
        ```
        250
        150
        50
        ```

## Usage

To run the entire pipeline, execute the `main.py` script from the project root:

```bash
pyenv activate dna-clustering-env # Ensure your environment is active
python main.py
```

The script will:
1.  Create dummy input files in `data/` if they don't exist.
2.  Calculate pairwise Needleman-Wunsch scores for species using `blosum_example.json`, `blosum50.json`, and `blosum62.json`.
3.  Save these scores to JSON files in the `output/` directory.
4.  Build phylogenetic trees for each BLOSUM matrix.
5.  Export the trees to Newick format (with and without distances) in `output/`.
6.  Draw and save horizontal dendrograms as PNG images in `output/`.
7.  Read thresholds from `thresholds.txt`.
8.  Calculate and print species clusters for each threshold to the console.
9.  Save the cluster results to JSON files in `output/`.

## Output Files

All generated output files will be saved in the `output/` directory:

*   **`organisms_scores_blosumXX.json`**: Pairwise Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores.
    *   **Format:** `{"Species1_Species2": score, ...}`
*   **`treeXX_newick.nw`**: Phylogenetic tree in Newick format (names only).
*   **`treeXX_newick_with_distance.nw`**: Phylogenetic tree in Newick format (names and branch lengths/distances).
*   **`phylogenetic_tree_blosumXX.png`**: Horizontal dendrogram visualization.
*   **`clusters_for_blosumXX.json`**: Clusters of species for each threshold.
    *   **Format:** `{"ThresholdValue": [["SpeciesA", "SpeciesB"], ["SpeciesC"], ...], ...}`

*(Note: `XX` will be replaced by the BLOSUM version, e.g., `50`, `62`, or `example`.)*

## Important Notes

*   **BLOSUM for DNA:** The project uses a custom interpretation of "BLOSUM" matrices for DNA, where single-character keys define gap penalties and two-character keys define substitution scores. This is distinct from standard protein BLOSUM matrices.
*   **Similarity to Distance Transformation:** Needleman-Wunsch scores are similarities (higher = more similar). For hierarchical clustering, these are transformed into distances using `distance = Max_Similarity_Score - Actual_Similarity_Score`. This ensures that higher similarity values correspond to smaller distances, allowing correct clustering and interpretation of dendrogram heights.
*   **Threshold Interpretation:** The thresholds in `thresholds.txt` are interpreted as *Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores*. The clustering algorithm internally converts these to corresponding distances for cutting the tree.


## Prompt number 15

**User:** Please rate each of the previously send prompts in terms of clarity, completeness and unambiguity in the scale 1-5, where 1 is the lowest score and 5 the highest. 
Clarity means that prompt was easy to understand and it was clear what should be provided as an answer. Completeness means that prompt did not lack any important informaton that needed to be "assumed" by you to provide the answer. Unambiguity means that there was only one way to understand the task. After scoring each prompt, give me an average score for each category. 


**LLM Response:**

Okay, I've reviewed each prompt you sent, focusing on clarity, completeness, and unambiguity. Here are my ratings for each, followed by the average scores.

---

### Prompt Ratings (1-5 Scale)

**1. Initial Project Description (First Prompt)**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - The overall goal and the high-level steps were very clear.
*   **Completeness:** 3/5 - While comprehensive, the mention of "BLOSUM matrix" for DNA sequences without specifying gap penalties or how a BLOSUM (typically amino acid) matrix would apply to DNA was a significant missing detail that required clarification.
*   **Unambiguity:** 3/5 - The "BLOSUM for DNA" was the main point of ambiguity. It could imply a standard BLOSUM (which is for amino acids) or a custom matrix for DNA. My first response sought to clarify this.

**2. Technical Expectations**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - Extremely clear and concise on all technical constraints.
*   **Completeness:** 5/5 - All necessary technical details for the environment, file paths, and coding standards were provided.
*   **Unambiguity:** 5/5 - No room for misinterpretation; all points were direct instructions.

**3. Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm - Input Files**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - Very clear on the task and the specific structure of both input JSON files.
*   **Completeness:** 5/5 - This prompt perfectly clarified the "BLOSUM for DNA" ambiguity from the first prompt by providing the exact structure and interpretation of the `blosumXX.json` file (single char for gap, two for substitution). The test case was also a great addition.
*   **Unambiguity:** 5/5 - The detailed example for `blosum.json` made the interpretation of costs completely unambiguous.

**4. Save NW Scores to JSON**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - Clear instructions on the output file format, naming convention, and key structure.
*   **Completeness:** 5/5 - All details for saving the scores were provided.
*   **Unambiguity:** 5/5 - The "species1_species2" key format was specific and left no room for misinterpretation.

**5. Phylogenetic Tree Outline**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - The goal of building a phylogenetic tree using agglomerative single-linkage clustering was very clear.
*   **Completeness:** 4/5 - While good, the phrase "distance metric equal to needleman-wunsch algorithm results" was slightly incomplete. Needleman-Wunsch results are *similarity* scores, and clustering algorithms typically use *distances*. This required me to propose and confirm the `Max_Score - Actual_Score` transformation to convert similarity to distance.
*   **Unambiguity:** 4/5 - The similarity-vs-distance point introduced a minor ambiguity that needed careful interpretation to ensure the clustering logic worked correctly (merging highest similarity first).

**6. Phylogenetic Tree Coding**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - Clear instructions for coding the tree building process based on the agreed-upon method.
*   **Completeness:** 5/5 - All necessary details for implementing the tree construction were present.
*   **Unambiguity:** 5/5 - No new ambiguities were introduced; it built directly on the clarified understanding.

**7. Newick Export**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - Very clear on the two required Newick formats and their respective naming conventions.
*   **Completeness:** 5/5 - All details for exporting to Newick were provided.
*   **Unambiguity:** 5/5 - No ambiguity regarding the output formats.

**8. Dendrogram & Clustering Outline**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - Both the dendrogram visualization requirements and the threshold-based clustering task were clearly articulated.
*   **Completeness:** 4/5 - For the clustering, the prompt stated "values are NW distances" in `thresholds.txt`, but then also "range of threshold values from NW scores." Given the tree was built on *distances derived from similarity*, interpreting these thresholds as *similarity scores* (which then need conversion to distances) was the most logical and consistent approach. This required an implicit clarification in my summary.
*   **Unambiguity:** 4/5 - The slight inconsistency in describing the `thresholds.txt` values (distances vs. scores) created a minor ambiguity that needed careful handling to ensure correct implementation.

**9. Dendrogram & Clustering Coding**
*   **Clarity:** 5/5 - Very clear on the output format for clusters (list of lists), printing to stdout, and saving to JSON with the specified key-value structure.
*   **Completeness:** 5/5 - All details for the final coding task were provided.
*   **Unambiguity:** 5/5 - No new ambiguities were introduced.

Overall, your prompts were exceptionally clear and well-structured, making it easy to understand the tasks. The minor deductions in completeness and unambiguity relate to specific bioinformatics domain details (like the "BLOSUM for DNA" and the similarity/distance interpretation for thresholds) that are common points of clarification in such projects. You provided excellent examples and detailed requirements throughout, which greatly aided in delivering a precise solution.

## Prompt number 16

**User:** Based on your ratings, please provide a short recommendation of how the prompts could be improved to generate better results.

**LLM Response:**

Based on the ratings, your prompts were already of very high quality, especially in clarity. The minor areas for improvement primarily revolve around **completeness** and **unambiguity** concerning domain-specific interpretations and data transformations.

Here are short recommendations on how the prompts could be improved to generate even better results, particularly in complex, multi-step projects like this:

1.  **Front-Load Domain-Specific Clarifications:**
    *   **Improvement:** If you're using a term in a non-standard way (e.g., "BLOSUM matrix" for DNA sequences), clarify its exact interpretation and structure in the *very first* prompt where it's introduced. This includes how gap penalties are defined if they're part of this custom matrix.
    *   **Why:** This prevents initial assumptions and ensures the foundational understanding is perfectly aligned from the start, avoiding the need for clarification in subsequent prompts. (e.g., the `blosumXX.json` structure and its interpretation for single-char vs. two-char keys was crucial and came in a later prompt).

2.  **Explicitly Define Data Transformations Upfront:**
    *   **Improvement:** When an algorithm requires a specific data type (e.g., clustering needs *distances*, but your input is *similarity scores*), explicitly state the desired transformation or ask for a proposal in the prompt where that algorithm is introduced.
    *   **Why:** This avoids ambiguity about how to convert between related but distinct concepts (like similarity vs. distance) and ensures the chosen method (e.g., `Max_Score - Actual_Score`) is agreed upon early. (e.g., "Needleman-Wunsch results are similarity scores. For clustering, we need a distance metric. Please use `distance = Max_Score - Actual_Score` for this transformation.")

3.  **Maintain Consistent Terminology for Thresholds/Metrics:**
    *   **Improvement:** Be precise and consistent when referring to values that might be interpreted in different ways (e.g., "Needleman-Wunsch distances" vs. "Needleman-Wunsch scores" for thresholds). Clearly state if a threshold refers to the original similarity score or the transformed distance.
    *   **Why:** This eliminates any potential for misinterpreting the scale or meaning of the values, especially when they are used to "cut" a tree built on a transformed scale. (e.g., "The `thresholds.txt` file will contain values representing *Needleman-Wunsch similarity scores*. These should be used to cut the tree, requiring conversion to the corresponding distance threshold.")

By incorporating these points, you can further reduce any potential for ambiguity or the need for clarifying questions, leading to even more direct and precise initial responses.
